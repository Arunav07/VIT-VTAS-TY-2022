As the directions which follow were intended for the conduct of the
families of the authoress’s own daughters, and for the arrangement of
their table, so as to unite a good figure with proper economy, she has
avoided all excessive luxury, such as essence of ham, and that wasteful
expenditure of large quantities of meat for gravy, which so greatly
contributes to keep up the price, and is no less injurious to those who
eat, than to those whose penury bids them abstain. Many receipts are
given for things which, being in daily use, the mode of preparing them
may be supposed too well known to require a place in a cookery book; yet
how rarely do we meet with fine melted butter, good toast and water, or
well made coffee! She makes no apology for minuteness in some articles,
or for leaving others unnamed, because she writes not for professed
cooks. This little work would have been a treasure to herself, when she
first set out in life, and she therefore hopes it may be useful to
others. In that idea it is given to the public, and as she will receive
from it no emolument, so she trusts it will escape without censure.

=Miscellaneous Observations=
FOR THE USE OF
THE MISTRESS OF A FAMILY;
BY WHICH MUCH MONEY WILL BE SAVED, AND THE GENERAL APPEARANCE GREATLY
IMPROVED.
The mistress of a family should always remember that the welfare and
good management of the house depend on the eye of the superior; and
consequently that nothing is too trifling for her notice, whereby waste
may be avoided; and this attention is of more importance, now that the
price of every necessary of life is increased to an enormous degree.
If a lady has never been accustomed, while single, to think of family
management, let her not upon that account fear that she cannot attain
it; she may consult others who are more experienced, and acquaint
herself with the necessary quantities of the several articles of family
expenditure in proportion to the number it consists of.
A minute account of the annual income, and the times of payment, should
be taken in writing; likewise an estimate of the supposed amount of each
article of expense; and those who are early accustomed to calculations
on domestic articles, will acquire so accurate a knowledge of what their
establishment requires, as will give them the happy medium between
prodigality and parsimony, without acquiring the character of meanness.
Ready money should be paid for all such things as come not into weekly
bills; and the best places for purchasing be attended to. In some
articles a discount of five per cent. is allowed in London, and other
large cities; and those who thus pay are usually best served. Under the
idea of buying cheap, many people go to new shops; but it is safest to
deal with people of established credit, who do not dispose of bad goods
by underselling.
To make people wait for their money injures them greatly, besides that a
higher price must be charged: perhaps the irregularity of payment may
have much evil influence on the price of various articles, and
contribute to the destruction of many families, in gradation downwards.
It is very necessary for a woman to be informed of the prices and
goodness of all articles in common use, and of the best times, as well
as places, for purchasing them. She should also be acquainted with the
_comparative_ prices of provisions, in order that she may be able to
substitute those that are most reasonable, when they will answer as
well, for others of the same kind, but which are more costly. A false
notion of economy leads many to purchase as bargains what is not wanted,
and sometimes never is used. Were this error avoided, more money would
remain for other purposes. Some things are better for keeping, and,
being in constant consumption, should be laid in accordingly; such as
paper, soap, and candles. Of these more hereafter.
A proper quantity of household articles should be always ready, and more
bought in before the others be consumed, to prevent inconvenience,
especially in the country.
A bill of parcels and receipts should be required, even if the money be
paid at the time of purchase; and, to avoid mistakes, let the goods be
compared with these when brought home.
Though it is very disagreeable to suspect any one’s honesty, and perhaps
mistakes have been unintentional, yet it is prudent to weigh meat,
sugars, &c. when brought in, and compare with the charge. The butcher
should be ordered to send the weight with the meat, and the cook to file
these checks, to be examined when the weekly bill shall be delivered.
A ticket should be given by the cook for each loaf, which will on return
give the number to be paid for.
Thus regularly conducted, the exact state of money affairs will be known
with ease; for it is delay of payment that occasions confusion.
Accounts should be regularly kept, and not the smallest articles omitted
to be entered; and if balanced every week and month, the income and
outgoings will be ascertained with facility, and their proportions to
other be duly observed. Some people approve of keeping in separate
purses the money for different purposes, as domestic articles, clothes,
pocket, education of children, &c.
Whichever way accounts be kept, some certain method should be adopted
and strictly adhered to.
Many families have owed their prosperity full as much to the conduct and
propriety of female management, as to the knowledge and activity of the
father.
Those who are served with brewer’s beer, or any other thing not paid for
on delivery, should have a book for entering the date; which will not
only prevent overcharges, but at one view give the annual consumption.
It is much to be feared, that for the waste of many of the good things
that God has given for our use, not abuse, the mistress and servants of
great houses will hereafter be called to a strict account.
Some part of every person’s fortune should be devoted to charity; by
which “a pious woman will build up her house before God, while she that
is foolish (_i. e._ lends nothing to the Lord) pulls it down with her
hands.” No one can complain of the want of gifts to the poor in this
land; but there is a mode of relief which would add greatly to their
comfort, and which being prepared from superfluity, and such materials
as are often thrown away, the expense would not be felt. In the latter
part of this work some hints for preparing the above are given.
By good hours, especially early breakfast, a family is more regular, and
much time is saved. If orders be given soon in the morning, there will
be more time to execute them; and servants, by doing their work with
ease, will be more equal to it, and fewer will be necessary.
It is worthy of notice, that the general expense will be reduced, if
every thing be kept in its proper place, applied to its proper use, and
mended, when the nature of an accident will allow, as soon as broken.
An inventory of furniture, linen, and china, should be kept, and the
things examined by it twice a year, or oftener, if there be a change of
servants; into each of whose care the articles used by him or her,
should be intrusted, with a list, as is done with plate. Tickets of
parchment with the family name, numbered, and specifying what bed it
belongs to, should be sewed on each feather bed, bolster, pillows, and
blankets.
Many well meaning servants are ignorant of the best means of managing,
and thereby waste as much as would maintain a small family, besides
causing the mistress of the house much chagrin by their irregularity;
and many families, from a want of method, have the appearance of chance
rather than of regular system. To avoid which the following hints may be
useful.
All things likely to be wanted should be in readiness; sugars of
different qualities should be kept broken, currants washed, picked and
dry in a jar; spice pounded, &c.
Where regular noonings or suppers are used (and in every house some
preparation is necessary for accidental visitors), care should be taken
to have such things in readiness as may be proper for either; a list of
several will be subjoined, a change of which will be agreeable, and if
properly managed will be attended with no great expense.
Every article should be kept in that place best suited to it, as much
waste may thereby be avoided, viz.
Vegetables will keep best on a stone floor if the air be excluded; meat
in a cold dry place; sugar and sweetmeats require a dry place; so does
salt; candles cold, but not damp; dried meats, hams, &c. the same; all
sorts of seeds for puddings, saloop, rice, &c. should be close covered
to preserve from insects. Flour should be kept in a cool perfectly dry
room, and the bag being tied should be changed upside down and back
every week, and well shaken. Soap should be cut with a wire or twine, in
pieces that form a long square, when first brought in, and kept out of
the air two or three weeks; for if it dry quick, it will crack, and when
wet break. Put it on a shelf, leaving a space between, and let it grow
hard gradually. Thus, it will save a full third in the consumption.
CHEESE should be washed and wiped if you wish to preserve it sound, and
the shelves be washed; changing the place every three or four weeks; but
if it be wanted to ripen, a damp cellar will bring it forward.
Bread is now so heavy an article of expense that all waste should be
guarded against, and having it cut in the room will tend much to prevent
it; since the scarcity in 1795 and 1800, that custom has been much
adopted. It should not be cut until a day old; earthen pans and covers
keep it best.
Rolls, muffins, or any sort of bread, may be made to taste new when two
or three days old, by dipping it uncut in water, and baking afresh or
toasting.
Eggs may be bought cheapest when the hens first begin to lay in the
spring, before they sit; in Lent and at Easter they become dear. They
may be preserved fresh by dipping them in boiling water, and instantly
taking them out, or by oiling the shell; either of which ways is to
prevent the air passing through it. They should be kept on shelves with
small holes to receive one in each, and be turned every other day.
Carrots, parsnips, and beet roots, should be kept in sand for winter
use, and neither they nor potatoes be cleared from the earth.
Store onions preserve best hung up in a dry cold room.
Straw to lay apples on should be quite dry, to prevent a musty taste.
Large pears should be tied up by the stalk.
Tarragon gives the flavour of French cookery, and in high gravies is a
great improvement; but should be added only a short time before serving.
Basil, savory, and knotted marjoram, or London thyme, to be used when
herbs are ordered; but with discretion, as they are very pungent.
Celery seeds give the flavour of the plant to soups.
Parsley should be cut close to the stalks, and dried on tins in a very
cool oven: it preserves its flavour and colour, and is very useful in
winter.
Artichoke bottoms which have been slowly dried, should be kept in paper
bags; and truffles, morels, lemonpeel, &c. in a dry place ticketed.
In towns, poultry being usually sold ready picked, the feathers, which
may occasionally come in in small quantities, are neglected: but orders
should be given to put them into a tub free from damp, and as they dry
to change them into paper bags, a few in each; they should hang in a dry
kitchen to season; fresh ones must not be added to those in part dried,
or they will occasion a musty smell, but they should go through the same
process. In a few months they will be fit to add to beds, or to make
pillows, without the usual mode of drying them in a cool oven, which may
be pursued if they are wanted before five or six months.
The best means to preserve blankets from moths is to fold and lay them
under the featherbeds that are in use, and they should be shaken
occasionally. When soiled, they should be washed, not scoured.
Candles made in cool weather are best; and when their price, and that of
soap, which rise and fall together, is likely to be higher, it will be
prudent to lay in the stock of both. This information the chandler can
always give; they are better for keeping eight or ten months, and will
not injure for two years, if properly placed in the cool; and there are
few articles that better deserve care in buying, and allowing a due
quantity of, according to the size of the family.
The price of starch depends upon that of flour; the best will keep good
in a dry warm room for some years; therefore when bread is cheap, it may
be bought to advantage, and covered close.
Pickles and sweetmeats should be preserved from air; where the former
are much used, small jars of each should be taken from the stock jar, to
prevent frequent opening.
Some of the lemons and oranges used for juice should be pared, first to
preserve the peel dry; some should be halved, and when squeezed, the
pulp cut out, and the outsides dried for grating. If for boiling in any
liquid, the first way is best. When these fruits are cheap, a proper
quantity should be bought, and prepared as hereafter directed,
especially by those who live in the country, where they cannot always be
had; and they are perpetually wanted in cookery.
When whites of eggs are used for jelly, or other purposes, contrive to
have pudding, custard, &c. to employ the yelks also. Should you not want
them for several hours, beat them up with a little water, and put them
in a cool place, or they will be hardened and useless. It was a mistake
of old, to think that the whites made cakes and puddings heavy; on the
contrary, if beaten long and separately, they contribute greatly to give
lightness, are an advantage to paste, and make a pretty dish beaten with
fruit, to set in cream, &c.
If copper utensils be used in the kitchen, the cook should be charged to
be very careful not to let the tin be rubbed off; and to have them fresh
done when the least defect appears, and never to put by any soup, gravy,
&c. in them, or any metal utensil; stone and earthen vessels should be
provided for those purposes, as likewise plenty of common dishes, that
the table set may not be used to put by cold meat.
Vegetables soon sour, and corrode metals and glazed red ware, by which a
strong poison is produced.
Vinegar by its acidity does the same, the glazing being of lead or
arsenic.
In hot weather, when it is difficult to preserve milk from becoming
sour, and spoiling the cream, it may be kept perfectly sweet by scalding
the new milk very gently, without boiling, and setting it by in the
earthen dish or pan that it is done in. This method is pursued in
Devonshire, and the milk is not skimmed under twenty four hours, and
would equally answer in small quantities for coffee, tea, &c.
Cream already skimmed may be kept twenty four hours if scalded without
sugar, and by adding to it as much powdered lump sugar as shall make it
pretty sweet will be good two days, keeping it in a cool place. Syrup of
cream may be preserved as above in the proportion of a pound and quarter
of sugar to a pint of perfectly fresh cream, keep it in a cool place two
or three hours; then put it in one or two ounce phials, and cork it
close. It will keep good thus for several weeks, and will be found very
useful on voyages.
To cool liquors in hot weather, dip a cloth in cold water, and wrap it
round the bottle two or three times, then place it in the sun; renew the
process once or twice.
The best way of scalding fruits, or boiling vinegar, is in a stone jar
on a hot iron hearth, or by putting the vessel into a saucepan of water,
called a waterbath.
The beautiful green given to pickles, formerly was made by the use of
bell mettle, brass, or copper, and consequently very injurious to the
stomach.
If chocolate, coffee, jelly, gruel, bark, &c. be suffered to boil over,
the strength is lost.
Marbles boiled in custard, or any thing likely to burn, will, by shaking
them in the saucepan, prevent it.
Gravies or soups, put by, should be daily changed into fresh scalded
pans. When there is fear of gravy meat being spoiled before it be
wanted, season it well, and lightly fry it, which will preserve it two
days longer; but the gravy is best when the juices are fresh. A receipt
for gravy that will keep a week is given under the article of SAUCES.
The cook should be encouraged to be careful of coals and cinders: for
the latter there is a new contrivance to sift, without dispersing the
dust of the ashes, by means of a covered tin bucket.
Small coal wetted makes the strongest fire for the back, but must remain
untouched until it cake. Cinders, lightly wet, give a great degree of
heat, and are better than coal for furnaces, ironing stoves, and ovens.
The cook should be charged to take care of jelly bags, tapes for the
collared things, &c. which, if not perfectly scalded, and kept dry, give
an unpleasant flavour when next used.
Cold water thrown on cast iron, when hot, will cause it to crack.
Hard water spoils the colour of vegetables; a pinch of pearlash, or salt
of wormwood, will prevent that effect.
When sirloins of beef, loins of veal or mutton, come in, part of the
suet may be cut off for puddings, or to clarify; dripping will baste
every thing as well as butter, fowls and game excepted; and for kitchen
pies, nothing else should be used.
The fat off a neck or loin of mutton makes a far lighter pudding than
suet.
Meat and vegetables that the frost has touched should be soaked in cold
water two or three hours before they are used, or more if much iced.
When put into hot water or to the fire until thawed, no heat will dress
them properly.
Meat should be well examined, when it comes in warm weather; and if
flies have touched it, the part must be cut off, and then well washed.
In the height of summer, it is a very safe way to let meat that is to be
salted lie an hour in the coldest water, rubbing it well there in any
part likely to have been flyblown; then wipe it perfectly dry, and have
ready salt, and rub it thoroughly into every part, leaving a handful
over it besides. Turn it every day, and rub the pickle in, which will
make it ready for the table in three or four days; if it is desired to
be very much corned, wrap it in a well floured cloth, having rubbed it
previously with salt. The latter method will corn fresh beef fit for
table the day it comes in; but it must be put into the pot when the
water boils.
If the weather permits, meat eats much better for hanging two or three
days before it be salted.
The water in which meat has boiled makes an excellent soup for the poor,
when vegetables, oatmeal or pease, are added, and should not be cleared
from the fat.
Roast beef bones, or shank bones of ham, make fine pease soup, and
should be boiled with the pease the day before eaten, that the fat may
be removed.
The mistress of the house will find many great advantages in visiting
her larder daily, before she orders her bill of fare: she will see what
things require dressing, and thereby guard against their being spoiled.
Many articles may be re-dressed in a different form from that in which
they were first served, and improve the appearance of the table without
increasing expense. Many dishes require to be made of dressed meat or
fowls. Directions for several are hereafter given.
In every sort of provisions, the best of the kind goes farthest; cutting
out most advantageously, and affording most nourishment. Round of beef,
fillet of veal, and leg of mutton, bear a higher price; but having more
solid meat, deserve the preference. It is worth notice, however, that
those joints which are inferior may be dressed as palatably, and being
cheaper, ought to be bought in turn; and, when weighed with the prime
pieces, the price of the latter is reduced.
In loins of meat, the long pipe which runs by the bone should be taken
out, being apt to taint; as likewise the kernels of beef. Rumps and
aitchbones of beef are often bruised by the blows the drovers give, and
that part always taints: avoid purchasing such.
The shank bones of mutton should be saved, and, after soaking and
brushing, may be added to give richness to gravies or soups; and they
are particularly nourishing for the sick.
The feet of pork make various good dishes, and should be cut off before
the legs be cured. Observe the same of the ears.
Calves’ tongues, salted, make a more useful dish than when dressed with
the brains, which may be served without.
Some people like neats’ tongues cured with the root, in which case they
look much larger; but should the contrary be approved, the root must be
cut off close to the gullet, next to the tongue, but without taking away
the fat under the tongue. The root must be soaked in salt and water, and
extremely well cleaned before it be dressed as hereafter directed: and
the tongue laid in salt for a day and night before pickled.
Great attention is requisite in salting meat; and in the country, where
great quantities are cured, it is of still more importance. Beef and
pork should be well sprinkled, and a few hours after hung to drain,
before it be rubbed with the preserving salts; which mode, by cleansing
the meat from the blood, tends to keep it from tasting strong. It should
be turned daily, and if wanted soon, rubbed. A salting tub, or lead, may
be used, and a cover should fit close. Those who use a good deal of salt
meat will find it answer well to boil up the pickle, skim, and, when
cold, pour it over meat that has been sprinkled and drained. Salt is so
greatly increased in price, from the heavy duties, as to require
additional care, and the brine ought not to be thrown away, as is the
practice of some, after once using.
In some families great loss is sustained by the spoiling of meat. The
best mode to keep that which is to be eaten unsalted is, as before
directed, to examine it well; wipe it daily, and pound some charcoal,
and throw over it. If meat is brought from a distance in warm weather,
the butcher should be charged to cover it close, and bring it early in
the morning; but even then, if it be kept on the road, while he serves
the customers who are nearest to him, it will probably be flyblown. This
is most frequent in the country.
Mutton will keep long by washing with vinegar, and peppering the broad
end of the leg; if any damp appears, wipe it immediately. If rubbed with
salt lightly, it will not eat the worse. Boiled in seawater, is by some
much admired.
Game is often brought in when not likely to keep a day, in the cook’s
apprehension; yet may be preserved two or three days, if wanted, by the
following method:
If birds, (woodcocks and snipes excepted, which must not be drawn) draw
them, pick, and take out the crop; wash them in two or three waters, and
rub them with a little salt. Have ready a large saucepan of boiling
water, and plunge them in one by one; boil each five minutes, moving it,
that the water may go through them. When all are finished, hang them by
the heads in a cold place; when drained, pepper the inside and necks.
When to be roasted, wash to take off the pepper. The most delicate
birds, even grouse, may be kept this way, if not putrid. Birds that live
by suction, &c. bear being high; it is probable that the heat might
cause them to taint more, as a free passage for the scalding water could
not be obtained. Hares ought not to be paunched in the field, as they
keep longer, and eat much better without. But that is seldom in the
cook’s power to guard against. She should take out the liver and heart,
and parboil the former to keep for stuffing, wipe the inside every day,
quite dry, put a bunch of parsley, or some pepper, or both; thus it will
keep long, especially if the seasoning be rubbed early on the inside to
prevent any mustiness of taste, which often is communicated to the
stuffing by this omission, and want of extreme nicety in washing it in
water and vinegar before it be dressed, while the outside has been
preserved fresh by the skin. If old, a hare should be kept as long as
possible, except for soup, or jugging; and after soaking, in vinegar, be
well larded.
Freshwater fish has often a muddy taste; to take off which, soak it in
strong salt and water, or, if of a size to bear it, give it a scald in
the same, after extremely good cleaning and washing. The latter for carp
or eels.
Turbot will hang three or four days, if lightly rubbed with salt, and be
in quite as great perfection as the first day.
Fish may sometimes be bought reasonably by taking more than can be
dressed at once; when recourse may be had to pickling, potting, or
frying, to keep for stewing a succeeding day.
When thunder or hot weather causes beer to turn sour, half, or a whole
teaspoonful of salt of wormwood should be put into a jug, and let the
beer be drawn in it as small a time as possible before it be drank.
If the subject of servants be thought ill timed in a book upon family
arrangement, it must be by those who do not recollect that the
regularity and good management of the heads will be insufficient, if not
seconded by those who are to execute orders. It behoves every person to
be extremely careful who they take into their employ; to be very minute
in investigating the character they receive; and equally cautious to be
scrupulously just in giving one to others. Were this attended to, many
bad people would be incapacitated from doing mischief, by abusing the
trust reposed in them. And it may be fairly asserted, that the robbery,
or waste (which is but a milder epithet) of an unfaithful servant, will
be laid to the charge of the master or mistress, who, knowing such
faults in him, or even having only well grounded suspicions, is led by
entreaty or false pity, to slide him into another place. To refuse
countenance to the evil, is to encourage the good servant; such as are
honest, frugal, and attentive to their duties, should be liberally
rewarded: and such discrimination would encourage merit, and inspire
servants with a zeal to acquit themselves with fidelity.
On the other side it may be proper to observe, that a retributive
justice usually marks persons in that station sooner or later even in
this world. Those who are extravagant and idle in their servitude, are
ill prepared for the industry and sobriety on which their own future
welfare much depends; their faults, and the attendant punishment, come
home when they have families of their own, and sometimes much sooner.
They will see their wickedness or folly in the conduct of their
offspring, whom they must not expect to be better than the examples that
are set them.
It was the observation of a sensible woman, that she could always read
the fate of her servants when they married from her; those who had been
faithful and industrious in her service, continued their good habits in
their own families, and became respectable members of the community;
those who had been unfaithful servants, never were successful, and not
unfrequently were reduced to the parish.
The manner of carving is not only a very essential knowledge in point of
doing the honours of the table with grace, but makes a great difference
in the family consumption; and, though in large companies, a lady is so
much assisted as to make the art of less consequence, yet she should not
fail to acquaint herself with an attainment of which she must daily feel
the want. Some people haggle meat so as not to be able to help six times
from a large tongue, or a piece of beef. It is to be observed that a
thin sharp carving knife, and with a very little strength to the
management of it, will cut deep thin slices, cause the joint to look
neatly, and leave sufficient for a second helping, instead of that
disgusting appearance which is sometimes observable. Habit alone can
make people carve, or do the honours of a table well; for those who have
not had practice, there are very good directions in a little book of
Trusler’s.
In the following, and indeed all other receipts, though the quantities
may be as accurately set down as possible, yet much must be left to the
discretion of the person who uses them. The different taste of people
requires more or less of the flavour of spices, garlic, butter, &c.
which can never be directed by general rules; and if the cook has not a
good taste, and attention to that of her employers, not all the
ingredients with which nature or art can furnish her, will give an
exquisite relish to her dishes. The proper articles should be at hand,
and she must proportion them until the true zest be obtained.
DOMESTIC COOKERY.
FISH.
_To boil Turbot._
The turbot kettle must be of a proper size, and in the nicest order. Set
the fish in cold water to cover it completely: throw a handful of salt
and one glass of vinegar into it; let it gradually boil; be very careful
that there fall no blacks, but skim it well, and preserve the beauty of
the colour.
Serve it garnished with a complete fringe of curled parsley, lemon, and
horseradish.
The sauce must be the finest lobster, and anchovy butter, and plain
butter, served plentifully in separate tureens.
_To stew Lamprey, as at Worcester._
After cleaning the fish carefully, remove the cartilage which runs down
the back, and season with a small quantity of cloves, mace, nutmeg,
pepper, and pimento. Put it in a small stewpot, with very strong beef
gravy, with port and equal quantity of Madeira or sherry wine.
It must be covered; stew till tender; then take out the lamprey and keep
it hot, while you boil up the liquor with two or three anchovies
chopped, and some flour and butter: strain the gravy through a sieve,
and add lemon juice and some made mustard. Serve with sippets of bread
and horseradish.
Eels, soals, and carp, done the same way, are excellent. When there is
spawn, it must be fried and put round.
Note. Cyder instead of white wine will do in common.
_Eel Pye._
Cut the eels in lengths of two or three inches: season with pepper and
salt, and place in the dish, with some bits of butter and a little
water, and cover it with paste.
_Spitchcock Eels._
Take a large one, leave the skin on, cut it in pieces of four inches
long, open it on the belly side, and clean it nicely: wipe it dry, and
then wet it with a beaten egg, and strew it over on both sides with
chopped parsley, pepper, salt, a very little sage, and a bit of mace
pounded fine, and mixed with the seasoning. Rub the gridiron with a bit
of suet, and broil the fish of a fine colour.
Serve with anchovy and butter for sauce.
_Fried Eels._
If small, they should be curled round and fried, being first dipped in
egg and crumbs of bread.
_Boiled Eels._
The small ones are preferable. Do them in a small quantity of water,
with a good deal of parsley, which should be served up with them and the
liquor.
Serve chopped parsley and butter for sauce.
_Eel Broth_,
Very nourishing for the sick.
As above; but to be stewed two hours, and an onion and peppercorns
added: salt to taste.
_Collared Eels._
Bone a large eel, but do not skin it: mix pepper, salt, mace, pimento,
and a clove or two, in the finest powder, and rub over the whole inside:
roll it tight, and bind it with a coarse tape. Boil it in salt and water
till enough; then add vinegar, and when cold, keep the collar in pickle.
Serve it whole, or in slices, garnished with parsley. Chopped sage,
parsley, and a little thyme, knotted marjorum, and savory, mixed with
the spices, greatly improve the taste.
_Perch and Tench._
Put them in cold water, boil them carefully, and serve with melted
butter and soy.
_Mackerel._
Boiled, and served with butter and fennel.
Broiled, being split and sprinkled with herbs, pepper and salt; or
stuffed with the same, crumbs and chopped fennel.
Collared, as eel above.
Potted. Clean, season, and bake them in a pan, with spice, bayleaves,
and some butter: when cold, lay them in a potting pot, and cover with
butter.
Pickled. Boil them; then boil some of the liquor, a few peppers,
bayleaves, and some vinegar: when cold, pour it over them.
_To pickle Mackerel, called Caveach._
Clean and divide, then cut each side in three; or, leaving them
undivided, cut each fish in five or six pieces. To six large mackerel,
take near an ounce of pepper, two nutmegs, a little mace, four cloves,
and a handful of salt, all in finest powder; mix, and, making holes in
each bit of fish, thrust the seasoning into them; rub each piece with
some of it; then fry them brown in oil; let them stand till cold, then
put them into a stone jar, and cover with vinegar: if to keep long, pour
oil on the top. This done, they may be preserved for months.
_To bake Pike._
Scale it, and open as near the throat as you can; then stuff it with the
following: grated bread, herbs, anchovies, oysters, suet, salt, pepper,
mace, half a pint of cream, four yelks of eggs; mix all, over the fire,
till it thickens, then put it into the fish, sew it up. Butter should be
put over in little bits: bake it. Serve sauce of gravy, butter, and
anchovy. _Note._ If, in helping a pike, the back and belly be slit up,
and each slice be gently drawn downwards, there will be fewer bones
given.
_Salmon to boil._
Clean it carefully, boil it gently, and take it out of the water as soon
as done; and let the water be warm if the fish be split.
Shrimp or anchovy sauce.
_Salmon to pickle._
Boil as above, take the fish out and boil the liquor with bayleaves,
peppercorns and salt; add vinegar when cold, and pour over the fish.
_Salmon to broil._
Cut slices about an inch thick; season, and put them into papers; twist
them, and broil gently. Serve in the papers. Anchovy sauce.
_Salmon to pot._
Take a large piece, scale and wipe, but do not wash it; salt it very
well: let it lie till the salt be melted and drained from it, then
season with beaten mace, cloves, and whole peppers. Lay in a few
bayleaves, put it close in a pan, and cover it over with butter, and
bake it. When well done, drain it from the gravy, put it in the pots to
keep; and when cold, cover with clarified butter.
Thus you may do any firm fish.
_Salmon to dry._
Cut the fish down, take out the inside and roe. Rub the whole with
common salt, after scaling it; let it hang to drain twenty four hours.
Pound three or four ounces of saltpetre, according to the size of the
fish, two ounces of bay salt, and two ounces of coarse sugar: rub these,
when mixed well, into the Salmon, and lay it on a large dish or tray two
days, then rub it well with common salt, and in twenty four hours more
it will be fit to dry: but you must dry it well after draining. Either
hang in a wood chimney, or in a dry place, keeping it open with two
small sticks.
_Lobsters to pot._
Boil them half, pick out the meat, cut into small bits: season with
mace, white pepper, nutmeg, and salt: press close into a pot and cover
with butter: bake half an hour: put the spawn in. When cold, take the
lobster out, and with a little of the butter put it into the pots. Beat
the other butter in a mortar with some of the spawn; then mix that
coloured butter with as much as will be sufficient to cover the pots,
and strain it. Cayenne may be added, if approved.
_Another way, as at Wood’s Hotel._
Take out the meat as whole as you can; split the tail and remove the
gut; if the inside be not watery, add that. Season with mace, nutmeg,
white pepper, salt, and a clove or two, in finest powder. Lay a little
fine butter at the bottom of a pan, and the lobster smooth over it, with
bayleaves between: cover it with butter and bake it gently. When done,
pour the whole on the bottom of a sieve, and with a fork lay the pieces
into potting pots, some of each sort with the seasoning about it. When
cold, pour clarified butter over, but not hot. It will be good next day;
or highly seasoned, and thick covered with butter, will keep some time.
The potted lobster may be used cold, or as a fricassee, with a cream
sauce, when it looks very nicely, and eats excellently, especially if
there be spawn.
Mackerel, herrings, and trout, are good potted as above.
_Stewed Lobster, as a very high Relish._
Pick the lobster, put the berries into a dish that has a lamp, and rub
them down with a bit of butter, two spoonfuls of any sort of gravy, one
of soy or walnut catsup, a little salt and Cayenne, and a spoonful of
port. Stew the lobster cut in bits with the gravy as above. It must be
dressed at table, and eaten immediately.
_Lobster Pie._
Boil two lobsters, or three small; take out the tails, cut them in two,
take out the gut, cut each in four pieces and lay them in a small dish.
Put in then the meat of the claws, and that you have picked out of the
body; pick off the furry parts from the latter, and take out the lady;
then take the spawn, beat it in a mortar, likewise all the shells. Set
them on to stew with some water, two or three spoonfuls of vinegar,
pepper, salt, and some pounded mace. A large piece of butter, rolled in
flour, must be added when the goodness of the shells is obtained. Give a
boil or two and pour into the dish strained: strew some crumbs over, and
put a paste over all. Bake slowly, but only till the paste be done.
_Curry of Lobsters or Prawns._
When taken out of the shells, simmer them as above.
_Buttered Lobsters._
Pick the meat out; cut it and warm with a little weak brown gravy,
nutmeg, salt, pepper, and butter, with a little flour. If done white, a
little white gravy and cream.
_Hot Crab._
Pick the meat out of a crab, clear the shell from the head, then put the
former, with a very small bit of nutmeg, salt, pepper, a bit of butter,
crumbs of bread, and three spoonfuls of vinegar, into the shell again,
and set it before the fire. You may brown it with a salamander.
Dry toast should be served to eat it upon.
_To dress Red Herrings._
Choose those that are large and moist; cut them open, and pour some
boiling small beer over them, to soak half an hour. Drain them dry, and
make them just hot through before the fire; then rub some cold butter
over them and serve. Egg sauce, or buttered eggs and mashed potatoes,
should be served with them.
_Baked Herrings or Sprats._
Wash and drain without wiping them. Season with Jamaica pepper in fine
powder, salt, a whole clove or two: lay them in a pan with plenty of
black pepper, an onion, and a few bayleaves. Put half vinegar and half
small beer, enough to cover them. Put paper over the pan, and bake in a
slow oven. If you like, throw saltpetre over them the night before, to
make them look red. Gut, but do not open them.
_To smoke Herrings._
Clean and lay them in salt, and a little saltpetre one night; then hang
them on a stick, through the eyes, on a row. Have ready an old cask, on
which put some sawdust, and in the midst of it a heater red hot; over
the smoke fix the stick, and let them remain twenty four hours.
_Fried Herrings._
Serve them of a light brown, and onions sliced and fried.
_Broiled Herrings._
Floured first, and done of a good colour. Plain butter for sauce. They
are very good potted like mackerel.
_Soals._
If boiled, they must be served with great care to look perfectly white,
and should be much covered with parsley.
If fried, dip them in egg, and cover them with fine crumbs of bread. Set
on a fryingpan that is just large enough, and put into it a large
quantity of fresh lard or dripping; boil it, and immediately slip the
fish into it. Do them of a fine brown. When enough, take them out
carefully, and lay them upon a dish turned under side uppermost, and
placed slantingly before the fire to drain off the fat. If you wish them
to be particularly nice, lay them on clean cap paper, and let lie some
minutes.
Observe, that fish never looks well if not fried in plenty of fat, and
_that_ boiling hot, before it be put into it. The dripping may serve
again with a little fresh. Take care the fat does not become black.
Butter makes every thing black that is fried in it. The soals should
just fit the inside of the dish, and a fringe of curled parsley garnish
the edge completely, which looks beautifully.
Soals that have been fried, eat good cold with oil, vinegar, salt, and
mustard. _Note._ Fine oil gives the finest colour, but is expensive.
_Stewed Soals, and Carp_,
Are to be done like lampreys.
_Soals, in the Portuguese way._
Take one large or two lesser; if the former, cut the fish in two; if
they are small, they need only be split. The bones being taken out, put
the fish into a pan, with a bit of butter and some lemonjuice: give it a
fry; then lay the fish on a dish, and spread a forcemeat over each
piece, and roll it round, fastening the roll with a few small skewers.
Lay the rolls into a small earthen pan; beat an egg and wet them, then
strew crumbs over, and put the remainder of the egg, with a little meat
gravy, a spoonful of caper liquor, an anchovy chopped fine, and some
parsley chopped, into the bottom of the pan; cover it close, and bake,
until the fish be done enough, in a slow oven. Then place the rolls in
the dish for serving; cover it to keep it hot until the gravy baked be
skimmed: if not enough, a little fresh, flavoured as above, must be
prepared and added to it.
The stuffing to be made as on the following page.
_Stuffing for Soals baked._
Pound cold beef, mutton, or veal, a little, then add some fat bacon,
that has been lightly fried, cut small, and some onions, a little
garlick or shalot, some parsley, anchovy, pepper, salt, and nutmeg.
Pound all fine with a few crumbs, and bind it with two or three yelks of
eggs.
The heads of the fish are to be left on one side of the split part, and
kept on the outer side of the roll; and when served, the heads are to be
turned towards each other in the dish.
Garnish with fried or dried parsley.
_Soal, Cod, or Turbot Pie: another sort of stuffing._
Boil two pounds of eels tender; pick all the flesh clean from the bones;
throw the latter into the liquor the eels were boiled in, with a little
mace, salt and parsley, and boil till very good, and come to a quarter
of a pint, and strain it. In the mean time cut the flesh of the eels
fine, likewise some lemonpeel, parsley, and an anchovy: put to them
pepper, salt, nutmeg, and some crumbs. Melt four ounces of butter and
mix, then lay it in a dish at the bottom: cut the flesh of two or three
soals clean from the bones, and fins; lay it on the forcemeat, and pour
the eelbroth in. The bones of the soals should be boiled with those of
the eels. You may boil them with one or two little eels, and pour it,
well seasoned, on the fish, and put no forcemeat.
_An excellent way of dressing a large Plaice, especially if there be a
roe._
Sprinkle it with salt, and keep it twenty four hours, then wash and wipe
it dry: wet it over with eggs; cover with crumbs of bread; make some
lard or fine dripping, and two large spoonfuls of vinegar boiling hot,
lay the fish in, and fry it a fine colour. Drain it from the fat, and
serve with fried parsley round, and anchovy sauce. You may dip the fish
in vinegar, and not put it in the pan.
_To fry Smelts._
They should not be washed more than necessary to clean. Dry in a cloth,
then lightly flour, but shake it off. Dip them in plenty of egg, then
into bread crumbs grated fine, and plunge them into a good pan of
boiling lard. Let them continue gently boiling, and a few minutes will
make them a bright yellow brown. Take care not to take off the light
roughness of the crumbs, or their beauty will be lost.
_Boiled Carp._
Serve in a napkin, and with the sauce directed for it among sauces.
_Cod’s head and shoulders_,
Will eat much finer, by having a little salt rubbed down the bone, and
along the thick part, even if to be eaten the same day.
Tie it up, and put on the fire in cold water which will completely cover
it: throw a handful of salt in it. Great care must be taken to serve it
without the smallest speck of black or scum. Garnish with a large
quantity of double parsley, lemon, horseradish, and the milt, roe, and
liver, and smelts fried, if approved. If the latter, be cautious that no
water hang about the fish, or the beauty of the smelts will be taken
off, as well as their flavour.
Serve with plenty of oyster or shrimp sauce, and anchovy, and butter.
Some people boil the cod whole; but there is no fish, that is more
proper to help, than in a large head and shoulders, the thinner parts
being overdone and tasteless before the thick be ready: but the whole
fish may be purchased, at times, more reasonably, and the lower half, if
sprinkled the least, and hung up, will be in high perfection one or two
days: or it may be made salter, and served with egg sauce, potatoes, and
parsnips.
_Crimp Cod._
Boil, broil, or fry.
_Cod sounds boiled._
Soak them in warm water till soft, then scrape and clean; and if to be
dressed white, boil them in milk and water, and when tender serve them
in a napkin. Egg sauce.
_Cod sounds ragout._
Prepare as above, then stew them in white gravy seasoned; cream, butter,
and a little bit of flour added before you serve, gently boiling up. A
bit of lemonpeel, nutmeg, and the least pounded mace, should give the
flavour.
_Curry of Cod_,
Should be made of sliced cod that has either been crimped, or sprinkled
a day to make it firm. Fry it of a fine brown, with onions, and stew it
with a good white gravy, a little curry powder, a bit of butter and
flour, three or four spoonfuls of rich cream, salt and Cayenne.
_Fish Pie._
Cod or Haddock, sprinkled with salt to give firmness, slice and season
with pepper and salt, and place in a dish mixed with oysters. Put the
oyster liquor, a little broth, and a bit of flour and butter, boiled
together, into the dish cold. Put a paste over; and when it comes from
the oven, pour in some warm cream. If you please you may put parsley
instead of oysters.
_Haddock._
Do the same as cod, and serve with the same sauce; or, stuff with
forcemeat as page eleventh. Or broil them with stuffing.
_Oysters to stew._
Open them and separate the liquor from them, then wash them from the
grit: strain the liquor, and put with the oysters a bit of mace and
lemonpeel, and a few white peppers. Simmer them very gently, and put
some cream, and a little flour and butter.
Serve with sippets.
_Scalloped Oysters._
Put them with crumbs of bread, pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a bit of
butter, in scallop shells or saucers, and bake them before the fire, in
a Dutch oven.
_Oyster Patties or small Pie._
As you open the oysters, separate them from the liquor, which strain;
parboil them, after taking off the beards. Parboil sweetbreads, and
cutting them in slices, lay them and the oysters in layers: season very
lightly with salt, pepper, and mace. Then put half a teacup of liquor,
and the same of gravy. Bake in a slow oven; and before you serve, put a
teacup of cream, a little more oyster liquor and a cup of white gravy,
all warmed, but not boiled. If for patties, the oysters should be cut in
small dice, gently stewed, and seasoned as above, and put into the paste
when ready for table.
_Fried Oysters, to garnish boiled fish._
Make a batter of flour, milk, and eggs; season it a very little; dip the
oysters in it, and fry them a fine yellow brown. A little nutmeg should
be put into the seasoning, and a few crumbs of bread into the flour.
_To pickle Oysters._
Wash four dozen of oysters in their own liquor; then strain, and in it
simmer them till scalded enough: take them out and cover them. To the
liquor put a few peppercorns, a blade of mace, a table spoonful of salt,
three of white wine, and four of vinegar: simmer fifteen minutes; and
when cold, pour it on the oysters, and keep them in a jar close covered.
_Another way._
Open the number you intend to pickle: put them into a saucepan, with
their own liquor, for ten minutes; simmer them very gently; then put
them into a jar, one by one, that none of the grit may stick to them,
and cover them, when cold, with the pickle thus made. Boil the liquor
with a bit of mace, lemon peel, and black peppers; and to every hundred,
put two spoonfuls of the best undistilled vinegar.
They should be kept in small jars, and tied close with bladder, for the
air will spoil them.
_Stuffing for Pike, Haddock, &c._
Of fat bacon, beefsuet, and fresh butter, equal parts; some parsley,
thyme, and savory; a little onion, and a few leaves of scented marjoram,
shred finely; an anchovy or two; a little salt and nutmeg, and some
pepper.
If you have oysters, three or four may be used instead of anchovies. Mix
all with crumbs of bread, and two yelks and whites of eggs, well beaten,
and parsley shred fine.
_Sprats_,
When cleaned, should be fastened in rows by a skewer, run through the
heads, and then broiled and served hot and hot.
Sprats baked, as herrings, page 8.
—— fried, as do. page 9.
_To dress fresh Sturgeon._
Cut slices, rub egg over, then sprinkle with crumbs of bread, parsley,
pepper, salt, and fold in paper, and broil gently.
Sauce; butter, anchovy, and soy.
_Thornback, or Skate_,
Should be hung one day at least, before it be dressed, and may be served
either boiled, or fried in crumbs, being first dipped in egg.
_Crimp Skate._
Boiled, and sent up in a napkin; or fried as above.
_Maids_,
Should be likewise hung one day at least. May be boiled or fried; or if
of a tolerable size, the middle may be boiled and the fins fried. They
should be dipped in egg, and covered with crumbs.
OBSERVATIONS ON DRESSING FISH.
If the fishmonger does not clean it, fish is seldom very nicely done;
but those in great towns wash it beyond what is necessary for cleaning,
and by perpetual watering diminish the flavor. When quite clean, if to
be boiled, some salt and a little vinegar should be put to the water to
give firmness; but cod, whiting and haddock, are far better if a little
salted, and kept a day; and if not very hot weather they will be good in
two days.
Those who know how to purchase fish, may, by taking more at a time than
they want for one day, often get it cheap, and that which will hang by
sprinkling, may then be bought to advantage.
The fish must be put into the water while cold, and set to do very
gently, or the outside will break before the inner part be done.
The fishplate on which it is done, may be drawn up to see if it be
ready; it will leave the bone when it is. It should be then immediately
taken out of the water, or it will be woolly. The fishplate should be
set crossways over the kettle, to keep hot for serving, and a clean
cloth should cover the fish to prevent its losing its colour.
Small fish, nicely fried in egg, and crumbs, make a dish of fish far
more elegant than served plain. Great attention should be paid to
garnishing fish; plenty of horseradish, parsley, and lemon.
When well done, and with very good sauce, fish is more attended to than
almost any other dish. The liver and roe should be placed on the dish,
so conspicuously that the lady may see them, and help a part to every
one. The sound of the cod, its head, and the head of carp are reckoned
the prime parts; and it is a part of necessary attention to help, or at
least offer some of the best to one’s friends; nor is it any excuse for
the mistress’s negligence, that it is the fashion of the present day for
those who sit at her right or left hand to help the company, which she
must see they do properly.
If salmon is to be dressed, great care is necessary that it be done
enough. No vinegar should be boiled with it.
If fish is to be fried or broiled, it must be wrapt in a nice soft
cloth, after it is well cleaned and washed. When perfectly dry, wet with
an egg, if the former way, and sprinkle the finest crumbs of bread over
it; then having a thick bottomed fryingpan on the fire, with a large
quantity of lard or dripping boiling hot, plunge the fish into it, and
let it fry middlingly quick, till the colour be a fine brown yellow, and
it be judged ready: if the latter take place first, the cook should draw
the pan to the side of the fire, lest the colour be spoiled. She should
then carefully take it up, and either place it on a large sieve turned
upwards, and to be kept for that purpose only, or on the underside of a
dish, to drain; and if wanted very nice, a sheet of cap paper must be
put to receive the fish, which should look a beautiful colour, and all
the crumbs appear distinct; the fish being free from all grease.
Garnish with a fringe of curled raw parsley, or parsley fried, which
must be thus done: when washed and picked, throw it again into clean
water; when the lard or dripping boils, throw the parsley into it
immediately from the water, and instantly it will be green, and crisp,
and must be taken up with a slice. This may be done after the fish is
fried.
If fish is to be broiled, it must be seasoned and floured, and put on a
gridiron that is very clean; and when hot, it should be rubbed with a
bit of suet to prevent the fish from sticking. It must be broiled on a
very clear fire, that it may not taste of smoke; and not too near, that
it may not be scorched.
_An excellent imitation of Sturgeon._
Take a fine large, but not an old turkey; pick it most nicely; singe it,
and make it very clean; bone, wash, and dry it; tie it across and
across, with a bit of mat string, washed clean, as they tie sturgeon.
Put into a very nice tin saucepan a quart of water, the same of vinegar,
and of white wine, that is not sweet, and a very large handful of salt.
Let boil, and skim well, then put in the turkey: when done, take it out
and tighten the strings. Let the liquor boil half an hour after, and
when cold put it on the turkey. If salt or vinegar be wanting, add when
cold. This will keep some months. You eat it with oil and vinegar, or
sugar and vinegar. It is more delicate than sturgeon, and makes a pretty
variety, if the real is not to be had. Cover it with fennel when brought
to table.
ON DRESSING MEATS.
Wash all meats before you dress; if for boiling, the colour will be
better for soaking; if for roasting, dry it.
Boiling in a well floured cloth, will make meat white.
Particular charge must be given that the pot be well skimmed the
_moment_ it boils, otherwise the foulness will be dispersed over the
meat. The more soups or broths are skimmed, the better and cleaner they
will be.
The boiler and utensils should be kept delicately clean.
Put the meat in cold water, and flour it well first. If meat be boiled
quick it will be hard; but care must be taken that in boiling slow it
does not cease, or the meat will be underdone.
If the steam be kept in, the water will not much decrease; therefore
when you wish to evaporate, remove the cover of the soup pot.
Vegetables should not be dressed with the meat, except carrots or
parsnips with boiled beef.
Weigh the joint, and allow a quarter of an hour to each pound, and about
twenty minutes over. If for roasting, it should be put at a good
distance from the fire, and brought gradually nearer when the inner part
becomes hot, which will prevent its being scorched while yet raw. Meat
should be much basted, and when nearly done, floured to make it look
frothed.
Veal and mutton should have a little paper put over the fat to preserve
it. If not fat enough to allow for basting, a little good dripping
answers as well as butter.
The cook should be careful to spit meat so as not to run the spit
through the best parts; and she should observe that her spit be well
cleaned before, and when she is going to serve, or a black stain appears
on the meat. In many joints the spit will pass into the bones, and run
along them for some distance, so as not to injure the prime of the meat;
and she should have leaden skewers to enable her to balance it; for want
of which, ignorant servants often are foiled in the time of serving.
In roasting meat, it is a very good way to put a little salt and water
into the dripping pan, and baste for a little while with it before it be
done with its own fat or dripping. When dry, dust it with flour, and
baste as usual.
Time, distance, basting often, and a clear fire, of a proper size for
what is required, are the first articles of a good cook’s attention in
roasting.
Old meats do not require so much dressing as young: not that they are
sooner done, but they can be eaten with the gravy more in.
Be careful in roasting wild fowls to keep a clear brisk fire. Roast them
of a light brown, but not till their gravy runs; they loose their fine
flavour if too much done. Tame fowls require more roasting: they are a
long time before they are hot through, and must be often basted to keep
up a froth, and it makes the colour better. Pigs and geese require a
brisk fire, and to be turned quick.
Hares and rabbits require time, and care to turn the two ends to the
fire, which are less likely to be done enough than the middle part.
Choose mutton by the fineness of its grain, the deep red of the flesh,
and bright whiteness of the fat. For roasting, it should hang as long as
it will keep, the hind quarter especially, but not so as to taint; for,
whatever fashion may authorize, putrid juices ought not to be conveyed
into the stomach.
Mutton, for boiling, will not look of a good colour if it has long hung.
Small mutton is preferred.
Great care should be taken to preserve by paper the fat of what is
roasted.
_To keep Venison._
Preserve the venison dry; wash it with milk and water very clean; dry it
with clean cloths, till not the least damp remain. Then dust pounded
ginger over every part, which is a good preventive against the fly. By
thus managing and watching, it will hang a fortnight. When to be used,
wash it with a little lukewarm water, and dry it.
_Venison._
A haunch of buck will take about three hours and three quarters
roasting; doe, three hours and a quarter. Put a coarse paste of brown
flour and water, and a paper over that, to cover all the fat: baste it
well with dripping, and keep it at a distance to get hot at the bone by
degrees. When nearly done, remove the covering, and baste it with
butter, and froth it up before you serve.
Gravy for it should be put into a boat, and not in the dish (unless
there be none in the venison), and made thus: cut off the fat from two
or three pounds of a loin of old mutton, and set it in steaks on a
gridiron for a few minutes, just to brown one side: put them in a
saucepan, with a quart of water: cover quite close for an hour, and
gently simmer it; then uncover, and stew till the gravy be reduced to a
point. Season with only salt.
Currantjelly sauce must be served in a boat.
Formerly pap sauce was eaten with venison, which, as some still like it,
may be necessary to direct. Grate white bread, and boil it with port and
water, a large stick of cinnamon; and when quite smooth, remove the
latter, and add sugar. Claret wine may be used for it.
Make the jelly sauce thus. Beat some currantjelly, and a spoonful or two
of port, then set it over the fire till melted. Where jelly runs short,
put more wine, and a few lumps of sugar to the jelly, and melt as above.
_To make a Pasty of Beef or Mutton, to eat as well as Venison._
Bone a small rump, or a piece of sirloin of beef, or a fat loin of
mutton: the former is better than mutton, after hanging several days, if
the weather permits. Beat it very well with a rolling pin, then rub ten
pounds of meat with four ounces of sugar, and pour over it a glass of
port wine, and the same of vinegar. Let it lie five days and nights:
wash and wipe the meat very dry, and season it very high with pepper,
Jamaica pepper, nutmeg, and salt. Lay in your dish, and to ten pounds
put one pound or near of butter, spreading it over the meat. Put a crust
round the edges, and cover with a thick one, or it will be overdone
before the meat be soaked. It must be done in a slow oven.
Set the bones in a pan in the oven, with no more water than will cover
them, and one glass of port wine, a little pepper and salt, that you may
have a little rich gravy to add to the pasty when drawn.
_Note._ Sugar gives a greater shortness, and better flavor to meats than
salt, too great a quantity of which hardens; and it is quite as great a
preservative.
_Haunch, Neck and Shoulders of Venison._
Roast with paste, as directed above, and the same sauce.
_Stewed Shoulder._
Let the meat hang till you judge proper to dress it, then take out the
bone: beat the meat with a rolling pin. Lay some slices of mutton fat,
that has lain a few hours in a little port wine, among it: sprinkle a
little black and Jamaica pepper over it, in finest powder: roll it up
tight, and fillet it. Set it in a stewpan that will only just hold it,
with some mutton or beef gravy, not strong, half a pint of port, and
some pepper and pimento. Simmer, close covered, and as slow as you can,
for three or four hours. When quite tender, take off the tape, set the
meat on a dish, and strain the gravy over. Serve with currantjelly
sauce.
This is the best way to dress this joint, unless it be very fat, and
then it should be roasted. The bone should be stewed with it.
_To prepare Venison for Pasty._
Take the bones out, then season and beat the meat. Lay it in a stone jar
in large pieces: pour upon it some plain drawn beef gravy, but not a
strong one: lay the bones on top, then set the jar in a waterbath, that
is, a saucepan of water over the fire; simmer three or four hours; then
leave it in a cold place till next day. Remove the cake of fat, and lay
the meat in handsome pieces on the dish: if not sufficiently seasoned,
add more pepper, salt, or pimento, as necessary. Put some of the gravy,
and keep the remainder for the time of serving. If the venison be thus
prepared, it will not require so much time to bake, or such a very thick
crust as is usual, and by which the under part is seldom done through.
_Venison Pasty._
A shoulder, boned, makes a good pasty; but it must be beaten and
seasoned, and the want of fat supplied by that of a fine well hung loin
of mutton, steeped twenty four hours in equal parts of rape, vinegar,
and port.
The shoulder being sinewy, it will be of advantage to rub it well with
sugar for two or three days; and when to be used, wipe it perfectly
clean from it, and the wine.
A mistake used to prevail, that venison could not be baked enough; but,
as above directed, three or four hours in a slow oven will be sufficient
to make it tender, and the flavor will be preserved. Either in shoulder
or side, the meat must be cut in pieces, and laid with fat between, that
it may be proportioned to each person, without breaking up the pasty to
find it. Lay some pepper and salt, at the bottom of the dish, and some
butter, then the meat nicely packed, that it may be sufficiently done,
but not lie hollow to harden at the edges.
The venison bones should be boiled with some fine old mutton. Of this
gravy put half a pint cold into the dish, then lay butter on the
venison, and cover, as well as line the sides with a thick crust; but do
not put one under the meat. Keep the remainder of the gravy till the
pasty comes from the oven; put it into the middle by a funnel, quite
hot, and shake the dish to mix well. It should be seasoned with pepper
and salt.
_An imitation of Venison Pasty._
Choose a large well fed loin of mutton; hang it ten days, then bone it,
leaving the meat as whole as possible. Cover it with brown sugar a day
and night; then lay it in a pickle of half a pint of port wine, and half
a pint of rape or common vinegar, twenty four hours more: then shake it
well in it to take off the sugar, but do not wash, only wipe it. Season
as above, and bake; making a gravy of the bones.
Crust for the pasty, see under the article of crusts.
_Hashed Venison_,
Should be warmed with its own, or gravy without seasoning, as before,
and only warmed through, not boiled. If there be no fat left, cut some
slices of mutton fat, set on the fire, with a little port wine and
sugar: simmer till dry; then add it to the hash, and it will eat as well
as that of the venison.
_Beef or Pork, to be salted for eating immediately._
The piece should not weigh more than five or six pounds. Salt it very
thoroughly just before you put it in the pot. Take a coarse cloth, flour
it well, put the meat in and fold it up close. Put it into a pot of
boiling water, and boil it as long as you would any salt beef of the
same size, and it will be as salt as if done four or five days.
_Beef Alamode._
Choose a piece of thick flank of a fine heifer or ox. Cut into long
slices some fat bacon, but quite free from yellow. Let each bit be near
an inch thick, and dip them in vinegar, and then in a seasoning ready
prepared of salt, black and Jamaica peppers and a clove in finest
powder, with parsley, chives, thyme, savory and knotted marjorum, shred
as small as possible, and well mixed. With a sharp knife make holes deep
enough to let in the larding; then rub the beef over with the seasoning,
and bind it up tight with tape. Set it in a well tinned pot over a fire
or rather stove. Three or four onions must be fried brown and put to the
beef, with two or three carrots, one turnip, and a head or two of
celery, and a small quantity of water. Let it simmer gently ten or
twelve hours, or till extremely tender, turning the meat twice.
Put the gravy in a pan, remove the fat, keep the beef covered, then put
them together, and add a glass of port wine. Remove the tape, and serve
with the vegetables: or you may strain them off, and send up fresh, cut
in dice for garnish. Onions roasted, and then stewed with the gravy, are
a great improvement. A teacup full of vinegar should be stewed with the
beef.
_Stewed rump of Beef._
Wash it well: season it high with pepper, Cayenne, salt, Jamaica pepper,
three cloves, a blade of mace, all in finest powder. Bind it up tight,
and lay it in a pot that will just hold it. Fry three large onions,
sliced, and put to it, with three carrots, two turnips, a shalot, four
cloves, a blade of mace, and some celery. Cover the meat with good beef
broth, or weak gravy. Simmer as gently as possible for several hours,
till quite tender. Clear off the fat, and add to the gravy half a pint
of port wine, a glass of vinegar, and a large spoonful of catsup; simmer
half an hour, and serve in a deep dish.
Garnish with carrots, turnips, or truffles, and morels, or pickles of
different colours cut small, and laid in little heaps separate, chopped
parsley, chives, beetroot, &c. If when done the gravy be too much to
fill the dish, take only a part to season for serving: the less wafer
the better; and to increase the richness, add a few beef bones and
shanks of mutton in stewing.
A spoonful or two of made mustard is a great improvement to the gravy.
Rump roasted is excellent; but in the country is generally sold whole
with the edgebone, or cut across instead of lengthways, as in London,
when there is one piece for boiling, and the rump for stewing or
roasting.
_Stewed Brisket._
Put the part that has the hard fat into a stew pot, with a small
quantity of water; let it boil up, and skim it thoroughly; then add
carrots, turnips, onions, celery, and a few peppercorns. Stew till
extremely tender; then take out the flat bones, and remove all the fat
from the soup. Either serve that and the meat in a tureen, or the former
alone, and the meat on a dish, garnished with some of the vegetables.
The following sauce is much admired, served with the beef. Take half a
pint of the soup, and mix with a spoonful of catsup, a glass of port
wine, a teaspoonful of made mustard, a little flour, a bit of butter,
and salt: boil all together a few minutes, then pour it round the meat.
Chop capers, walnuts, red cabbage, pickled cucumbers, and chives or
parsley, small, and put in separate heaps over it.
_To salt Beef red, which is extremely good to eat fresh from the pickle,
or to hang to dry._
Choose a piece of beef with as little bone as you can, the flank is most
proper: sprinkle it, and let it drain a day; then rub it with common
salt, saltpetre, and bay salt, but of the second a small proportion; and
you may add a few grains of cochineal, all in fine powder. Rub the
pickle every day into the meat for a week, then only turn it.
It will be excellent in eight days. In sixteen, drain it from the
pickle, and let it be smoked at the oven mouth, where heated with wood,
or send to the baker’s. A few days will smoke it.
A little of the coarsest sugar may be added to the salt.
It eats well boiled tender with greens or carrots. If to be grated as
Dutch, then cut a _lean_ bit: boil it till extremely tender; and while
hot put it under a press. When cold, fold it in a sheet of paper, and it
will keep in a dry place two or three months.
_Pressed Beef._
Salt a bit of brisket, thin part of the flank, or the tops of the ribs,
with salt and saltpetre, five days; then boil it gently till extremely
tender. Put it under a great weight, or in a cheese press, till
perfectly cold.
It eats excellently cold, and for Sandwiches.
_Hunter’s Beef._
To a round of beef that weighs twenty five pounds, take three ounces of
saltpetre, three ounces of coarsest sugar, an ounce of cloves, one
nutmeg, half an ounce of pimento, and three handfuls of common salt, all
in the finest powder.
The beef should hang two or three days, then rub the above well into it.
Turn and rub it daily for two or three weeks. The bone must be removed
at first. When to be dressed, dip it in cold water to take off the loose
spice: bind it up tight with tape: put it into a pan, and a teacup of
water at bottom: put over the pan a brown crust and paper, and bake it
five or six hours. When cold, remove the paste and fillet.
The gravy is very fine, and a little of it adds greatly to the flavor of
any hash, soup, &c.
Both gravy and beef will keep some time. The latter should be cut with a
very sharp knife, and quite smooth, to prevent waste.
_Collared Beef._
Choose the thin end of the flank of fine mellow beef, but not too fat.
Lay it in a dish with salt, and saltpetre. Turn and rub it every day for
a week, and keep it cool. Then take out every bone and gristle; remove
the skin of the inside part, and cover it thick with the following
seasoning cut small: a large handful of parsley, the same of sage, some
thyme, marjorum, pennyroyal, pepper, salt and pimento. Roll the meat up
as tight as possible, and bind it; then boil it gently for seven or
eight hours. A cloth must be put round before the tape. Put the beef
under a good weight while hot, without undoing it; the shape will then
be oval. Part of a breast of veal, rolled in with the beef, looks and
eats very well.
_Beefsteak and Oyster Sauce._
Strain off the liquor from the oysters, and throw them in cold water to
take off the grit, while you simmer the former with a bit of mace and
lemonpeel; then put the oysters in, stew them a few minutes, and add a
little cream if you have it, and some butter, rubbed in a bit of flour;
let them boil up once, and have rump steaks, well seasoned and broiled,
ready for throwing the oyster sauce over the moment you are to serve.
_Staffordshire Beefsteaks._
Beat them a little with a rolling pin: flour and season them; then fry
with sliced onion to a fine light brown. Lay the steaks in a stewpan,
and pour as much boiling water over as will serve for sauce: stew them
very gently half an hour, and add a spoonful of catsup or walnut liquor
before you serve.
_Italian Beefsteaks._
Cut a fine large steak from a rump that has been well hung; or it will
do from any _tender_ part. Beat it, and season with pepper, salt and
onion. Lay it in an iron stewpan, that has a cover to fit quite close;
set it at the side of a fire, without water. Take care it does not burn,
but it must have a strong heat. In two or three hours it will be quite
tender, then serve with its own gravy.
_Beef Collop._
Cut thin slices of beef from the rump or other tender parts, and divide
them in pieces three inches long: beat with the blade of a knife, and
flour them. Fry the collops quick in butter two minutes; then lay them
in a small stewpan, and cover with a pint of gravy: add a bit of butter
rubbed in flour, pepper, salt, the least bit of shalot shred as fine as
possible, half a walnut, four small pickled cucumbers, and a teaspoonful
of capers cut small. Observe it does not boil; and serve the stew in a
very hot covered dish.
_Beefsteak Pudding._
Prepare some fine steaks as above: roll them with fat between, and if
you approve _shred_ onion, add a very little. Lay a paste of suet in a
bason, and put in the rollers of steaks: cover the bason with a paste,
and pinch the edges to keep the gravy in. Cover with a cloth tied close,
and let the pudding boil slowly, but for a length of time.
_Beefsteak Pie._
Prepare the steaks as above, and when seasoned and rolled with fat in
each, put them in a dish, with puff paste round the edges. Put a little
water in the dish, and cover it with a good crust.
_Baked Beefsteak Pudding._
Make a batter of milk, two eggs, and flour, or which is much better,
potatoes boiled and mashed through a colander. Lay a little of it at the
bottom of the dish, then put in the steaks prepared as above, and very
well seasoned; pour the remainder of the batter over them, and bake it.
_Podovies, or Beef Patties._
Shred raredone dressed beef, with a little fat: season with pepper,
salt, and a little shalot or onion. Make a plain paste, roll it thin,
and cut it in shape like an apple puff; fill it with the mince, pinch
the edges, and fry them of a nice brown. The paste should be made with a
small quantity of butter, egg, and milk.
_Beef Palates._
Simmer them in water several hours, till they will peel; then cut the
palates in slices, or leave them whole, as you choose, and stew them in
a rich gravy till as tender as possible. Before you serve, season with
Cayenne, salt, and catsup. If the gravy was drawn clear, add to the
above some butter and flour.
_Beef Cakes for side dish of dressed meat._
Pound some beef that is raredone, with a little fat bacon or ham. Season
with pepper, salt, and a little shalot or garlic: mix them well, and
make into small cakes three inches long, and half as wide and thick: fry
them a light brown, and serve them in a good thick gravy.
_Potted Beef._
Take two pounds of lean beef, rub it with saltpetre, and let it lie one
night; then salt with common salt, and cover it with water four days in
a small pan. Dry it with a cloth, and season with pepper: lay it into as
small a pan as will hold it; cover it with coarse paste, and bake it
five hours in a very cool oven. Put no liquor in.
When cold, pick out the strings and fat; beat the meat very fine with a
quarter of a pound of fine butter just warm, but not oiled, and as much
of the gravy as will make it into a paste. Put it into very small pots,
and cover them with melted butter.
_Another way._
Take beef that has been dressed, either boiled or roasted: beat it in a
mortar with some pepper, salt, a few cloves, grated nutmeg, a little
fine butter just warm.
This eats as well, but the colour is not so fine.
_Hessian Soup and Ragout._
Clean the root of a tongue very nicely, and half an ox head, with salt
and water, and soak them afterwards in plain water; then stew them in
five or six quarts of water till tolerably tender. Let the soup stand to
be cold: take off the cake of fat, which will make good paste for hot
meat pies, or serve to baste. Put to the soup a pint of split peas or a
quart of whole, twelve carrots, six turnips, six potatoes, six large
onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, and two heads of celery. Simmer them
without the meat, till the vegetables are done enough to pulp with the
peas through a sieve, when the soup will be about the consistence of
cream. Season it with pepper, salt, mace, pimento, a clove or two, and a
little Cayenne, all in the finest powder. If the peas are bad, the soup
may not be thick enough; then boil in it a slice of roll, and put
through the colander; or put a little rice flour, mixing it by degrees.
_The Ragout._
Cut the nicest part of the head in small thick pieces, the kernels, and
part of the fat of the root of the tongue. Rub these with some of the
same seasoning, as you put them into a quart of the liquor, kept out for
that purpose before the vegetables were added; flour well, and simmer
them till nicely tender. Then put a little mushroom and walnut catsup, a
little soy, and a glass of port wine, a teaspoonful of made mustard, and
boil all up together before served.
If for company, small eggs and forcemeat balls.
This mode furnishes an excellent soup, and a ragout at small expense,
and they are uncommon. The other part will warm for the family.
_Stewed Oxcheek plain._
Soak and cleanse a fine cheek the day before you would have it eaten.
Put it into a stewpot that will cover close, with three quarts of water:
simmer it, after it has first boiled up and been well skimmed. In two
hours put plenty of carrots, leeks, two or three turnips, a bunch of
sweet herbs, some whole pepper, and four Jamaica’s. Skim frequently.
When the meat is tender, take it out: let the soup go cold: remove the
cake of fat, and serve it separate or with the meat.
It should be of a fine brown, which may be done by burnt sugar, or by
frying some onions quite brown with flour, and simmering them with it.
The latter improves the flavour of all soups and gravies of the brown
kind.
If vegetables are not approved in the soup, they may be taken out, and a
small roll be toasted, or bread fried and added. Celery is a great
addition, and should be always served. Where it is not to be got, the
seed gives an equally good flavour, boiled in, and strained off.
_To dress an Oxcheek another way._
Soak half a head three hours, and clean it with plenty of water. Take
the meat off the bones; put it into a pan with a large onion, a bunch of
sweet herbs, some bruised pimento, pepper, and salt.
Lay the bones on the top: pour on two or three quarts of water: cover
the pan close with brown paper, or a dish that will fit close. Let it
stand eight or ten hours in a slow oven, or simmer it by the side of the
fire, or on a hot hearth. When done tender, let it go cold, having moved
the meat into a clean pan. Take the cake of fat off, and warm the head
in pieces in the soup. Put what vegetables you choose.
_Marrow Bones._
Cover the top with floured cloth: boil, and serve with dry toast.
_To dress the Inside of a cold Sirloin of Beef._
Cut out all the meat, and a little fat, in pieces as thick as your
finger, and two inches long. Dredge with flour, and fry in butter, of a
nice brown. Drain the butter from the meat, and toss up in a rich gravy,
seasoned with pepper, salt, anchovy, and shalot. On no account let it
boil. Before you serve, add two spoonfuls of vinegar.
Garnish with crimped parsley.
_Fricassee of cold Roast Beef._
Cut the beef into very thin slices: shred a handful of parsley very
small: cut an onion in quarters, and put all together into a stewpan,
with a piece of butter, and some strong broth. Season with salt and
pepper, and simmer very gently a quarter of an hour; then mix into it
the yelks of two eggs, a glass of port wine, and a spoonful of vinegar:
stir it quick, and, rubbing the dish with shalot, turn the fricassee
into it.
_To dress Cold Beef that has not been done enough, called Beef Olives._
Cut slices half an inch thick, and four square: lay on them a forcemeat
of crumbs of bread, shalot, a little suet or fat, pepper, and salt. Roll
them, and fasten with a small skewer. Put them into a stewpan, with some
gravy made of the beef bones, or the gravy of the meat, and a spoonful
or two of water, and stew them till tender. Fresh meat will do.
_To dress ditto, called Sanders._
Mince small beef or mutton, onion, pepper, and salt; add a little gravy:
put into scallopshells or saucers: make them three parts full; then fill
them up with potatoes, mashed with a little cream: put a bit of butter
on the top, and brown them in an oven, or before the fire.
_To dress ditto, called Cecils._
Mince any kind of meat, crumbs of bread, a good deal of onion, some
anchovies, lemonpeel, salt, nutmeg, chopped parsley, and pepper, and a
bit of butter warm, and mix these over a fire for a few minutes. When
cool enough, make them up into balls of the size and shape of a turkey’s
egg, with an egg. Fry them, when sprinkled with fine crumbs, of a yellow
brown, and serve with gravy as above.
_Minced Beef._
Shred fine the underdone part, with some of the fat. Put into a small
stewpan, some onion, or shalot, (a very little will do,) a little water,
pepper, and salt: boil till the onion be quite soft; then put some of
the gravy of the meat to it, and the mince. Do not let it boil. Having a
small hot dish, with sippets of bread ready, pour the mince into it; but
first mix a large spoonful of vinegar with it: or if shalot vinegar,
there will be no need of the onion, or raw shalot.
_Hashed Beef._
Do the same, only the meat is to be in slices; and you may add a
spoonful of walnut liquor or catsup.
Observe, that it is owing to boiling hashes or minces, that they are
hard. All sorts of stews, or meat dressed second hand, should only be
simmered; and the latter only hot through.
_To preserve Suet a twelvemonth._
As soon as it comes in, choose the firmest part, and pick free from skin
and veins. In a very nice saucepan, set it at some distance from the
fire, that it may melt without frying, or it will taste.
When melted, pour it into a pan of cold water. When in a hard cake, wipe
it very dry: fold it in fine paper, and then in a linen bag, and keep in
a dry, but not hot place. When used, scrape it fine; and it will make a
fine crust, either with or without butter.
_Round of Beef_,
Should be carefully salted, and wet with the pickle for eight or ten
days. The bone should be cut out first, and the beef skewered and
filleted, to make it quite round. It may be stuffed with parsley, if
approved; in which case, the holes to admit it must be made with a sharp
pointed knife, and the parsley coarsely cut and stuffed in tight. As
soon as it boils, it should be skimmed, and afterwards kept boiling very
gently.
_To roast Tongue and Udder._
After cleaning the tongue well, salt it with common salt and saltpetre
three days; then boil it, and likewise a fine young udder, and some fat
to it, till tolerably tender; then tie the thick part of one to the thin
part of the other, and roast the tongue and udder together.
Serve them with a good gravy, and currantjelly sauce. A few cloves
should be stuck in the udder.
This is an excellent dish.
_To pickle Tongues for boiling._
Cut off the root, leaving a little of the kernel and fat. Sprinkle some
salt, and let it drain from the slime till next day: then, for each
tongue, mix a large spoonful of common salt, the same of coarse sugar,
and about half as much of saltpetre; rub it well in, and do so every
day. In a week add another heaped spoonful of salt. If rubbed every day,
a tongue will be ready in a fortnight; but if only turned in the pickle
daily, it will keep four or five weeks without being too salt.
If you dry tongues, write the date on a parchment and tie on. Smoke
them, or plainly dry them, if you like best.
When to be dressed, boil it extremely tender: allow five hours; and if
done sooner, it is easily kept hot. The longer kept after drying, the
higher it will be: if hard, it may require soaking three or four hours.
_Another way._
Clean as above. For two tongues, one ounce of saltpetre, and one ounce
of sal prunella. Rub them well. In two days, having well rubbed them,
cover them with common salt. Turn them daily for three weeks; then dry,
rub in bran, and paper or smoke them. In ten days they will be fit to
eat if not dried.
_Beef Heart._
Wash with care. Stuff as you do hare, and serve with rich gravy, and
currantjelly sauce.
Hash with the same, and port wine.
_Tripe._
Tripe may be served in a tureen. Stewed with milk and onion till tender.
Melted butter for sauce.
Or, fried in small bits dipped in butter: or stew the thin part, cut in
bits, in gravy, and thicken with flour and butter, and add a little
catsup: or fricasseed with white sauce.
_Bubble and Squeak._
Boil, chop, and fry, with a little butter, pepper, and salt, some
cabbage, and lay on it slices of raredone beef, lightly fried.
In both the following receipts, the roots must be taken off the tongue
before salted.
_Stewed Tongue._
Salt a tongue with saltpetre and common salt for a week, turning it
daily. Boil it tender enough to peel. When done, stew it in a moderately
strong gravy. Season with soy, mushroom catsup, Cayenne, pounded cloves,
and salt if necessary.
Serve with truffles, morels, and mushrooms.
_An excellent mode of doing Tongues to eat cold._
Season with common salt and saltpetre, brown sugar, a little bay salt,
pepper, cloves, mace, and pimento, in finest powder, for fourteen days:
then remove the pickle, put it in a small pan, and lay some butter on
it; cover with a brown crust, and bake slowly till so tender that a
straw would pierce it.
The thin part of tongues, if hung up to become dry, grate as hung beef;
and likewise make a fine addition to the flavour of omlets.
_Leg of Veal._
Let the fillet be cut large or small, as best suits the number of your
company. The bone being taken out, fill the space with a fine stuffing,
and let it be skewered quite round, and send the large side uppermost.
When half roasted, if not before, put a paper over the fat, and observe
to allow a sufficient time, and to put it a good distance from the fire,
the meat being very solid. You may pot some of it.
_Knuckle._
As few people are fond of boiled veal, it may be well to leave the
knuckle small, and to take off some cutlets or collops, before it be
dressed; but as the knuckle will keep longer than the fillet, it is best
not to cut off the slices till wanted. Break the bones to make it take
less room; and, washing it well, put it into a saucepan with three
onions, a blade of mace or two, and a few peppercorns; cover with water,
and simmer it till thoroughly ready. In the mean time some macaroni
should be boiled with it, if approved; or rice, or a little rice flour,
to give it a small degree of thickness; but do not put too much. Before
it be served, add half a pint of milk and cream, and let it come up with
or without the meat.
Or, fry the knuckle, with sliced onion and butter, to a good brown, and
have ready peas, lettuce, onion, a cucumber or two, stewed in a small
quantity of water an hour, then add to the veal, and stew till the meat
be tender enough to eat, not to be overdone. Throw in pepper, salt, and
a bit of shred mint, and serve altogether.
_Cutlets Maintenon._
Cut slices about three quarters of an inch thick; beat them with a
rolling pin, and wet them on both sides with egg: dip them into a
seasoning of bread crumbs, parsley, thyme, knotted marjorum, pepper,
salt, and a little nutmeg grated; then put them in papers folded over,
and broil them; and have ready in a boat, melted butter, with a little
mushroom catsup.
_Cutlets another way._
Prepare as above, and fry them. Lay them in a dish, and keep them hot.
Dredge a little flour, and put a bit of butter into the pan, brown it;
then pour a little boiling water into it, and boil quick. Season with
pepper, salt, and catsup, and pour over them.
_Another way._
Prepare as before, and dress the cutlets in a Dutch oven. Pour over them
melted butter and mushrooms. Or, pepper, salt, and broil, especially
neck steaks. They are excellent without herbs.
_Collops dressed quick._
Cut them as thin as paper, with a very sharp knife, and in small bits.
Throw the skin, and any odd bits of the veal into a little water, with a
dust of pepper and salt: set them on the fire while you beat the
collops, and dip them in a seasoning of herbs, bread, pepper, salt, and
a scrape of nutmeg, having first wetted them in egg; then put a bit of
butter into a frying pan, and give the collops a very quick fry; for as
they are so thin, two minutes will do them on both sides. Put them into
a hot dish before the fire, then strain and thicken the gravy. Give a
boil in the fryingpan, and pour over the collops. A little catsup is an
improvement.
_Another way._
Fry them in butter, only seasoned with salt and pepper: then simmer them
in gravy, white or brown, with bits of bacon served with them.
If white, add lemonpeel and mace, and some cream.
_Veal Collops._
Cut long thin collops: beat them well, and lay on them a bit of thin
bacon the same size; and spread forcemeat on that, seasoned high, with
the addition of a little garlick, and Cayenne. Roll them up tight, about
the size of two fingers, but not more than two or three inches long. Put
a very small skewer to fasten each firm. Rub egg over them, and fry of a
fine brown, and pour over them a rich brown gravy.
_Scollops of cold Veal or Chicken._
Mince the meat extremely small, and set it over the fire, with a scrape
of nutmeg, a little pepper and salt, and a little cream, for a few
minutes; then put it into the scallopshells, and fill them with crumbs
of bread; over which put some bits of butter, and brown them before the
fire.
Veal or chicken, as above prepared, served in a dish, and lightly
covered with crumbs of bread fried (or they may be put on in little
heaps), look and eat well.
_Scotch Collops._
Cut veal in thin bits, about three inches over, and rather round: beat
with a rolling pin: grate a little nutmeg over them: dip in the yelk of
an egg, and fry them in a little butter, of a fine brown: pour it from
them; and have ready warm, to pour upon them, half a pint of gravy, a
little bit of butter rubbed into a little flour, to which put a yelk of
an egg, two large spoonfuls of cream, and a bit of salt. Do not boil the
sauce, but stir it until of a fine thickness to serve with the collops.
_Kidney._
Chop veal kidney, and some of the fat, likewise a little leek or onion,
pepper, salt. Roll it up with an egg into balls, and fry them.
Cold fillet makes the finest potted veal; or you may do it as follows:
Season a large slice of the fillet before dressed, with some mace,
peppercorns, and two or three cloves, and lay it close into a potting
pan that will but just hold it, and fill it up with water, and bake it
three hours. Then pound it quite small in a mortar, and add salt to
taste. Put a little gravy, that was baked, to it in pounding, if to be
eaten soon; otherwise only a little butter just melted.
When done, cover it over with butter.
_To pot Veal or Chicken with Ham._
Pound some cold veal or white of chicken, seasoned as above, and put
layers of it with layers of pounded ham, or rather shred: press each
down, and cover over with butter.
_Neck of Veal._
Cut off the scrag to boil, and cover it with onion sauce. It should be
boiled in milk and water. Parsley and butter may be served with it,
instead of the former sauce; or it may be stewed with whole rice, small
onions, and peppercorns, with a very little water; or boiled and eaten
with bacon and greens.
Best end, roasted, broiled as steaks, or made into pies.
_Breast of Veal._
Before roasted, if large, the two ends may be taken off and fried to
stew, or the whole may be roasted. Butter should be poured over it.
If any be left, cut the pieces in handsome sizes, and putting them into
a stewpan, pour some broth over it; or if you have none, a little water
will do. Add a bunch of herbs, a blade or two of mace, some pepper, and
an anchovy. Stew till the meat is tender: thicken with butter and flour,
and add a little catsup; or the whole breast may be stewed, after
cutting off the two ends.
The sweetbread is to be served up whole in the middle; and if you have a
few mushrooms, truffles, and morels, stew them with it, and serve.
Boiled breast of veal, smothered with onion sauce, is an excellent dish,
if not old, or too fat.
_Rolled Breast of Veal._
Bone it, and take off the thick skin and gristle, and beat the meat with
a rolling pin. Season with herbs chopped very fine, mixed with salt,
pepper, and mace. Lay some thick slices of fine ham, or roll into it two
or three calves’ tongues of a fine red, and boiled first an hour or two
and skinned. Bind it up tight in a cloth, and tape it. Set it over the
fire to simmer in a small quantity of water until it be quite tender.
Some hours will be necessary.
Lay it on the dresser with a board and weight on it till quite cold.
Pigs’ or calves’ feet, boiled and taken from the bones, may be put in or
round it. The different colours, laid in layers, look well when cut; and
yelks of eggs boiled may be put in, with beet root, grated ham, and
chopped parsley.
_Shoulder of Veal._
Cut off the knuckle of the shoulder, for a stew or gravy. Roast the
other part, with stuffing. You may lard it. Serve with melted butter.
Blade bone, with a good devil of meat left on, eats extremely well with
mushroom or oyster sauce; or mushroom catsup in butter.
_Different ways of dressing Calf’s head._
TO BOIL.
Clean it very nicely, and soak it in water, that it may look very white.
Take out the tongue to salt, and the brains to make a little dish. Boil
the head extremely tender; then strew it over with crumbs and chopped
parsley, and brown them; or, if preferred, leave one side plain.
Bacon and greens are to be served to eat with it.
The brains must be boiled, and then mixed with melted butter, chopped
scalded sage, pepper, and salt.
If any be left of the head, it may be hashed next day, and a few slices
of bacon just warmed and put round.
Cold calf’s head eats well.
_Hashed Calf’s Head._
When half boiled, cut off the meat in slices, half an inch thick, and
two or three inches long. Brown some butter, flour, and sliced onion,
and throw in the slices with some good gravy, truffles, and morels. Give
it one boil, skim it well, and set it in a moderate heat to simmer till
very tender.
Season with pepper, salt, and Cayenne, at first; and ten minutes before
serving, throw in some shred parsley, and a very small bit of tarragon,
and knotted marjorum, cut as fine as possible. Just before you serve,
add the squeeze of a lemon. Forcemeat balls and bits of bacon rolled
round.
_Mock Turtle._
Bespeak a calf’s head with the skin on: cut in half, and clean it well;
then half boil it. Have all the meat taken off in square bits, and break
the bones of the head: boil them in some veal and beef broth, to add to
the richness. Fry some shalot in butter: dredge in flour sufficient to
thicken the gravy, which stir into the browning, and give it one or two
boils: skim carefully, then put in the head. Put in a pint of Madeira
wine, and simmer till the meat be quite tender. About ten minutes before
you serve, put in some basil, tarragon, chives, parsley, Cayenne pepper,
and salt to your taste; and two spoonfuls of mushroom catsup, and one of
soy. Squeeze the juice of a lemon into the tureen, and pour the soup
upon it. Forcemeat balls, and small eggs.
_A cheaper way._
Prepare half a calf’s head, without the skin, as above. When the meat is
cut off, break the bones, and put into a saucepan, with some gravy made
of beef and veal bones, and seasoned with fried onions, herbs, mace, and
pepper. Have ready two or three ox palates, boiled so tender as to
blanch, and cut in small pieces; to which a cowheel, likewise cut in
pieces, is a great improvement. Brown some butter, flour, and onion, and
pour the gravy to it; then add the meats as above, and stew. Half a pint
of sherry wine, an anchovy, two spoonfuls of walnut catsup, the same of
mushroom, some chopped herbs as before. Balls, &c.
_Forcemeat as for Turtle, at the Bush, Bristol._
A pound of fine fresh suet, one ounce of ready dressed veal or chicken,
chopped fine, crumbs of bread, a little shalot or onion, salt, white
pepper, nutmeg, mace, pennyroyal, parsley, and lemon; thyme finely
shred: beat as many fresh eggs, yelks and whites separately, as will
make the above ingredients into a moist paste: roll into small balls,
and boil them in fresh lard, putting them in just as it boils up. When
of a light brown, take them out, and drain them before the fire. If the
suet be moist or stale, a great many more eggs will be necessary.
Balls made this way are remarkably light; but being greasy, some people
prefer them with less suet and eggs.
_Another Forcemeat, for Balls or Patties._
Pound cold veal or chicken: take out the strings: add some fat bacon;
and, if you like, the least portion of scraped ham: herbs, as for the
preceding: pepper, salt, a little nutmeg, crumbs of bread, a little
onion, and two eggs.
_Note._ When forcemeat is to be eaten cold, as in pies, bacon is far
better than suet, and the taste is always higher.
_Another Mock Turtle._
Put into a pan a knuckle of veal, two fine cowheels, two onions, a few
cloves, peppers, Jamaica peppers, mace, and sweet herbs: cover with
water, and then, tying a thick paper over the pan, set it in an oven for
three hours. When cold, take off the fat very nicely: cut the meat and
feet into bits an inch and half square: remove the bones and coarser
parts; then put the other on to warm, with walnut and mushroom catsup, a
large spoonful of each, half a pint of sherry or Madeira wine, a little
mushroom powder, and the jelly of the meat. When hot, if it want any
more seasoning, add it, and serve with hard eggs, forcemeat balls, a
juice of lemon, and a spoonful of soy.
This is a very easy process, and the dish is excellent.
_Another Ditto._
Stew a pound and a half of scrag of mutton, with three pints of water to
a quart; then set the broth on, with a calf’s foot and a cowheel: cover
the stewpan tight, and simmer till you can cut off the meat from the
bones in proper bits. Set it on again, with the broth, a quarter of a
pint of Madeira or sherry wine, a large onion, half a teaspoonful of
Cayenne pepper, a bit of lemonpeel, two anchovies, some sweet herbs, and
eighteen oysters cut in pieces, and then chopped fine, a teaspoonful of
salt, a little nutmeg, and the liquor of the oysters: cover tight, and
simmer three quarters of an hour. Serve with forcemeat balls, and hard
eggs in the tureen.
_Note._ Cowheels, with veal or head, are a great improvement; and if not
too much boiled, have a very fine flavour stewed for turtle; and are
more solid than the calf’s feet.
_Calf’s Head Pie._
Stew a knuckle of veal till fit for eating, with two onions, a few
isinglass shavings, a bunch of herbs, 2 blade of mace, and a few
peppercorns, in two quarts or less of water. Keep the broth for the pie.
Take off a bit of the meat for the balls, and let the other be eaten;
but simmer the bones in the broth till it is very good. Half boil the
head, and cut it in square bits: put a layer of ham at the bottom, then
some head, first fat then lean, with balls and hard eggs cut in half,
and so on till the dish be full; but be particularly careful not to
place the pieces close, or the pie will be too solid, and there will be
no space for the jelly. The meat must be first pretty well seasoned with
pepper and salt, and a scrape or two of nutmeg. Put a little water and a
little gravy into the dish, and cover it with a tolerably thick crust:
bake it in a slow oven; and when done, pour into it as much gravy as it
can possibly hold, and do not cut it till perfectly cold: in doing
which, observe to use a very sharp knife, and first cut out a large bit,
going down to the bottom of the dish; and when done thus, the different
colours, and the clear jelly, have a beautiful marbled appearance.
A small pie may be made to eat hot; which, with high seasoning, oysters,
mushrooms, truffles, morels, &c. has a very good appearance.
The cold pie will keep some days. Slices make a pretty side dish.
The pickled tongues of former calves’ heads may be cut in, to vary the
colour, instead of, or besides ham.
_Calf’s Head Fricasseed._
Clean, and half boil half a head. Cut the meat in small bits, and put
into a tosser, with a little gravy made of the bones, and some of the
water it was boiled in, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, and a blade of
mace. If you have a sweetbread, or young cockerels in the house, use the
cockscombs; having first boiled them tender and blanched. Season the
gravy with a little pepper, nutmeg, and salt: rub down some flour and
butter, and give all a boil together; then remove the herbs and onion,
and add a little cup of cream, but do not boil it in. Serve with small
bits of bacon rolled round, and balls.
_Veal Patties._
Mince some veal, that is not quite done, with a little parsley,
lemonpeel, a scrape of nutmeg, and a little salt: add a little cream and
gravy just to moisten the meat; and if you have any ham, scrape a little
bit and add to it. Do not warm it till the patties are baked; and
observe to put a bit of bread into each, to prevent the paste from
rising into cake.
_Fricandeau._
Cut a large piece out of the prime part of a leg of veal, about nine
inches long, and half as broad and thick: beat it with a rolling pin;
then lard it very thickly on one side and the edges. Put it in a small
stewpan, with three pints of water, a pound of veal cut in small bits,
and four or five ounces of lean ham, and an onion: simmer till the meat
be tender; then take it out; cover to keep it moist, and boil the gravy
till it be a fine brown, and much reduced: then put the larded meat back
into the gravy, and pour a little of it over with a spoon. When quite
hot, serve the meat and gravy round in the dish, with the following
sauce in a boat.
_Sorrel Sauce._
Wash a quantity of sorrel, and boil it tender in the smallest quantity
of water you can: strain and chop it: stew it with a little butter,
pepper, and salt; and if you like it high, add a spoonful of gravy.
Be careful to do it in a very well tinned saucepan; or if you have a
silver one, or a silver mug, it is far better; as the sorrel is very
sour, especially in spring.
_Veal Olives._
Cut long thin collops: beat them, and lay on them thin slices of fat
bacon, and over a layer of forcemeat seasoned high, with the addition of
shred shalot, and Cayenne. Roll them tight, about the size of two
fingers, but not more than two or three inches long: fasten them round
with a small skewer: rub egg over, and fry them of a light brown.
Serve with brown gravy.
_Calf’s Liver._
Sliced: seasoned with pepper and salt, and nicely broiled. Rub a bit of
cold butter on it, and serve hot and hot.
_Roasted._
Wash and wipe it: then cut a long hole in it, and stuff it with crumbs
of bread, chopped anchovy, herbs, a good deal of fat bacon, onion, salt,
pepper, a bit of butter, and an egg. Sew the liver up; then lard or wrap
it in a veal caul, and roast it.
Serve with a good brown gravy, and currant jelly.
_Sweetbreads._
Half boil, and stew in a white gravy. Add cream, flour, butter, nutmeg,
salt, and white pepper: or, in brown, seasoned: or, after parboiling,
cover with crumbs, herbs, and seasoning, and brown in a Dutch oven.
Serve with butter, and mushroom catsup, or gravy.
_Sweetbread Ragout._
Cut them about the size of a walnut: wash and dry them; then fry of a
fine brown. Pour to them a good gravy, seasoned with salt, pepper,
allspice, mushrooms, or the catsup. Strain, and thicken with butter, and
a little flour. You may add truffles, and morels, and the mushrooms.
_Veal Sausages._
Chop equal quantities of lean veal and fat bacon, a handful of sage, a
little salt, pepper, and a few anchovies. Beat all in a mortar; and,
when used, roll and fry it, and serve with fried sippets.
Spadbury’s veal and pork sausages, under the article of pork.
_To make excellent meat of a Hog’s Head._
Split the head, take out the brains, cut off the ears, and sprinkle it
with common salt for a day; then drain. Salt it well with common salt
and saltpetre three days; then lay salt and head into water (a small
quantity) for two days. Wash it, and boil it till all the bones will
come out: remove them, and chop the head as quick as possible; having
skinned the tongue, and taken the skin carefully off the head, to put
under and over. Season with pepper, salt, a little mace or Jamaicas. Put
the skin into a small pan: press the cut head in, and put the other skin
over: press it down. When cold, it will turn out and make a kind of
brawn. If too fat, you may put a few bits of lean pork to go through the
same process. Add salt and vinegar, and boil with some of the liquor for
a pickle to keep it.
_To scald a Sucking Pig._
The moment the pig is killed, put it into cold water for a few minutes;
then rub it over with a little rosin, beaten extremely small, and put it
into a pail of scalding water half a minute; take it out, lay it on a
table, and pull off the hair as quickly as possible. If any part does
not come off, put it in again. When perfectly clean, wash it well with
warm water, then in two or three cold waters, lest any flavour of the
rosin should remain. Take off the four feet at the first joint: make a
slit down the belly, and take out the entrails: put the liver, heart,
and lights to the feet; wash the pig well in cold water, dry it
thoroughly, and fold it in a wet cloth to keep it from the air.
_To roast a sucking Pig._
If you can get it when just killed, it is of great advantage. Let it be
scalded, which those who sell usually do. Then put some sage, crumbs of
bread, salt, and pepper in the belly, and sew it up. Observe to skewer
the legs back, or the under part will not crisp.
Lay it to a brisk fire till thoroughly dry; then have ready some butter,
in a dry cloth, and rub the pig with it in every part. Dredge as much
flour over as will possibly lie, and touch it no more till ready to
serve; then scrape off the flour, with the greatest care, with a blunt
knife: rub it well with the buttered cloth: take off the head while yet
at the fire, and take out the brains, and mix them with the gravy that
comes from the pig. Then take it up, and, without withdrawing the spit,
cut it down the back and belly: lay it in the dish, and chop the sage
and bread quickly, as fine as you can, and mix with a large quantity of
fine melted butter, which has very little flour. Put the sauce into the
dish after the pig has been split down the back, and garnished with the
two ears, and the two _jaws_; the upper part of the head being taken off
down to the snout.
In Devon, it is served whole if very small; the head only being cut off.
_Pettitoes._
Boil them, and the liver and heart, in a small quantity of water very
gently; then cut the meat fine, and simmer it with a little of the water
and the feet split, till the latter be quite tender. Thicken with a bit
of butter, a little flour, a spoonful of cream, a little salt, and
pepper: give a boil up, and pour over a few sippets of bread, and put
the feet on the mince.
_Porker’s Head roasted._
Choose a fine young head, clean it well, and put bread and sage as for
pig: sew it up tight, and put it on a string or hanging jack. Roast it
as a pig, and serve with the same sauce.
_Pig’s Cheek for boiling._
Cut off the snout, and clean the head: divide it, take out the eyes and
the brains, and sprinkling the head with salt, let it drain twenty four
hours. Salt it with common salt and saltpetre. Let it lie eight or ten
days, if to be dressed without stewing with peas; but less, if to be
dressed with peas; and it must be washed first, and then simmered till
all is tender.
_Collared Head._
Scour the head and ears nicely: take off the hair and snout, and take
out the eyes and the brain: lay it in water one night; then drain and
salt it extremely well with common salt and saltpetre, and let it lie
five days. Boil it enough to remove the bones, then lay it on a dresser,
turning the thick end of one side of the head towards the thin end of
the other, to make the roll of equal size, sprinkle it well with salt
and white pepper, and roll it with the ears; and if you approve, put the
pig’s feet round the outside when boned; or the thin parts of two
cowheels. Bind it in a cloth and with a broad tape, and boil it till
quite tender; then put a good weight upon it, and do not remove the
covering till cold.
If you choose it to be more like brawn, salt it longer, and let the
proportion of saltpetre be greater, putting in some pieces of lean pork,
and then cover it with cowheel, to look like the horn.
This may be kept in or out of pickle of salt, and water boiled, with
vinegar; and is a very convenient thing to have in the house.
If likely to spoil, slice and fry it with or without butter.
_To roast a Leg of Pork._
Choose a small leg of fine young pork, cut a slit in the knuckle with a
sharp knife, and fill the space with sage and onion, chopped, and a
little pepper and salt. When half done, score the skin in slices, but do
not cut deeper than the outer rind.
Apple sauce and potatoes should be served to eat with it.
_To boil a Leg of Pork_
Salt it eight or ten days; when to be dressed, weigh it; let it lie half
an hour in cold water to make it white; allow a quarter of an hour for
every pound, and half an hour over from the time it boils up; skim it as
soon as it boils, and frequently after. Allow water enough. Save some of
it to make pease soup. Some boil in a very nice cloth, floured, which
gives a very delicate look.
Serve pease pudding and turnips.
_Different ways of dressing Pig’s Feet and Ears._
Clean them carefully, and soak them some hours: boil them tender, then
take them out; and with some of the water boil some vinegar and a little
salt, and when cold put over them. When to be dressed, dry them, divide
the feet in two, and slice the ears; fry and serve them with butter,
mustard, and vinegar. They may be done in butter or only floured.
_Feet and Ears Fricasseed._
Put no vinegar in the pickle, if to be dressed with cream. Cut the feet
and ears into neat bits, and boil them in a little milk; then pour that
from them, and simmer in a little veal broth, with a bit of onion, mace
and lemonpeel. Before you serve, add a little cream, flour, butter, and
salt.
_Jelly of Feet and Ears._
Clean and prepare as in the foregoing receipt; then boil in a very small
quantity of water until every bone can be taken out; throw in half a
handful of chopped sage, the same of parsley, a seasoning of pepper,
salt, and mace, in fine powder; simmer till the herbs are scalded, then
pour the whole into a melon form.
_Pork Steaks._
Cut them from a loin or neck, of middling thickness: pepper and broil
them, turning often. When nearly done, put the salt necessary, rub a bit
of butter over, and serve the moment they are taken off the fire; a few
at a time.
_To cure Hams. First way._
Hang them a day or two; then sprinkle with a little salt, and drain them
another day. Pound an ounce and a half of saltpetre, ditto petresalt,
half an ounce of sal prunel, and a pound of the coarsest sugar: mix
these well, and rub into each ham every day for four days, and turn it.
If a small one, turn it every day for three weeks: if a large one, a
week longer; but do not rub after four days. Before you dry it, drain
and cover with bran. Smoke it ten days.
_Another way. Second way._
Choose a leg of a hog that is fat and well fed: hang as above. To it, if
large, put, in fine powder, one pound of bay salt, four ounces
saltpetre, one pound of the coarsest sugar, and one handful of common
salt, and rub it thoroughly. Lay the rind downwards, and cover the
fleshy part with the salts. Baste it as often as you can with the
pickle; the more the better. Keep it four weeks in the pickle, turning
it daily. Drain and throw bran over it; then hang it in a chimney where
wood is burnt, and turn it sometimes for ten days.
_Another way. Third way._
Hang the ham and sprinkle with salt as above, then rub it daily with the
following in fine powder: half a pound of salt, ditto bay salt, two
ounces of saltpetre, and two ounces of black pepper, mixed with a pound
and a half of treacle. Turn it twice a day in the pickle, for three
weeks. Lay it in a pail of water for one night, wipe it quite dry, and
smoke it two or three weeks.
_Another way, that gives a high flavour. Fourth way._
When the weather will permit, hang the ham three days: mix an ounce of
saltpetre with one quarter of a pound of bay salt, ditto common salt,
ditto of coarsest sugar, and a quart of strong beer; boil them together,
and pour over immediately on the ham; turn it twice a day in the pickle
for three weeks. An ounce of black pepper, ditto of pimento, in finest
powder, added to the above, will give still more flavour. Cover with
bran when wiped, and smoke from three to four weeks, as you approve; the
latter will make it harder, and more of the flavour of Wesphalia. Sew
hams in hessings, i.e. coarse wrapper, if to be smoked where there is
strong fire.
_A method of giving a still higher flavour._
Sprinkle the ham with salt after it has hung two or three days: let
drain; make a pickle of a quart of strong beer, half a pound of treacle,
an ounce of coriander seeds, two ounces of juniper berries, an ounce of
pepper, ditto pimento, an ounce of saltpetre, half an ounce of sal
prunel, a handful of common salt, and a head of shalot, all pounded or
cut fine. Boil these together a few minutes, and pour over the ham: this
quantity for one of ten pounds. Rub and turn it every day, for a
fortnight; then sew it up in a thin linen bag, and smoke it three weeks.
Observe to drain it from the pickle, and rub it in bran previous to
drying.
_Hogs’ Cheeks to dry._
The snout being cut off, the brains removed, and the head cleft, but not
cut apart on the upper side, rub it well with salt. Next day remove the
brine, and salt it again; the following day cover the head with half an
ounce of saltpetre, two ounces of bay salt, a little common, and four
ounces of coarsest sugar. Let the head be often turned. In twelve days
smoke for a week like bacon.
_To dress Hams._
If long hung, put the ham into water a night, and either dig a hole in
the earth, or let it lie on damp stones, sprinkled with water to mellow,
two or three days, covering it with a heavy tub, to keep vermin from it.
Wash it well, and put it into a boiler with plenty of water. Let it
simmer four, five, or six hours, according to the size. When
sufficiently done, if before the time of serving, cover it with a clean
cloth doubled, and keep the dish hot over boiling water. Remove the
skin, and strew raspings over the ham. Garnish with carrot. Preserve the
skin as whole as possible, to keep over the ham when cold, which will
prevent its drying.
_The manner of curing Wiltshire Bacon._
Sprinkle each flitch with salt, and let the blood drain off for twenty
four hours; then mix one pound and a half of coarse sugar, ditto of bay
salt, not quite so much as half a pound of saltpetre, and a pound of
common salt, and rub it well on the bacon, turning it every day for a
month; then hang it to dry, and afterwards smoke it ten days. The above
salts are for the whole hog.
_To pickle Pork._
The quantities proportioned to the middlings of a pretty large hog; the
hams and shoulders being cut off.
Mix and pound fine four ounces of saltpetre, one pound of coarse sugar,
one ounce of sal prunel, and a little common salt. Having sprinkled the
pork with salt, and drained it twenty four hours, rub it with the above,
and then pack the pieces light in a small deep tub, filling up the
spaces with common salt. Place large pebbles on the pork, to prevent its
swimming in the pickle which the salt will produce.
_Sausages._
Chop fat and lean of pork: season with sage, pepper, and salt; and you
may add two or three pimentos. _Half fill_ hog’s guts, that have been
soaked and made extremely clean: or the meat may be kept in a very small
pan, closely covered; and so rolled and dusted with a very little flour
before they are fried.
_An excellent Sausage to eat cold._
Season fat and lean pork with some salt, saltpetre, black and Jamaica
pepper, all in finest powder, and well rubbed into the meat. The sixth
day cut it small, and mix with it some shred shalot, or garlick, as fine
as possible. Have ready an ox gut that has been scoured, salted, and
soaked well, and fill it with the above stuffing: tie up the ends, and
hang it to smoke as you would hams; but first wrap it in a fold or two
of old muslin. It must be high dried. Some eat it without boiling,
others like it boiled first. The skin should be tied in different
places, making each link about eight or nine inches long.
_Spadbury’s Oxford Sausages._
Chop a pound and a half of pork, and the same of veal, cleared of skins
and sinews. Add three quarters of a pound of beef suet, mince and mix
them. Steep the crumbs of a penny loaf in water, and with a little dried
sage, pepper, and salt, mix with the meat.
_Black Puddings._
The blood must be stirred with salt till cold. Put a quart of it, or
rather more, to a quart of old grits, to soak one night; and soak the
crumbs of a quartern loaf in rather more than two quarts of new milk,
made hot. In the mean time prepare the guts, by washing and scraping
with salt and water, and changing the water several times. Chop fine a
little winter savory and thyme, a great deal of pennyroyal, pepper,
salt, a few cloves, allspice, ginger, and nutmeg. Mix these with three
pounds of beefsuet, and six eggs well beaten and strained, and then beat
the bread, grits, &c. all up with the seasoning. When well mixed, have
ready some hogs fat cut in large bits, and as you fill the skins put it
in at proper distances. Tie them in links, having only half filled them,
and boil them in a large kettle, pricking them as they swell, or they
will burst. When boiled, lay them between clean cloths till cold, and
hang them up in the kitchen. When to be used, scald them a few minutes
in water, wipe and put them in a Dutch oven.
If there are not sufficient skins, put the stuffing in basons, and boil,
covered with floured cloths; and slice and fry it when used.
_Black Puddings another way._
Soak a quart of bruised grits in two quarts of hot milk, or less, if
sufficient to swell them. Chop a good quantity of pennyroyal, some
savory and thyme; salt, pepper, and Jamaica pepper, finely powdered. Mix
the above with a quart of the blood, prepared as before: then half fill
the skins, after they have been cleaned most thoroughly, and put as much
of the leaf, i. e. fat of the pig, as shall make it pretty rich. Boil as
before directed.
_White Hogs’ Puddings._
When the skins have been soaked and cleaned as before directed, rinse
and soak them all night in rosewater, and put into them the following
filling; mix half a pound of blanched almonds, cut in seven or eight
bits, with one pound of grated bread, two pounds of marrow or suet, one
pound of currents, some beaten cinnamon, cloves, mace, and nutmeg, a
quart of cream, yelks of six, and whites of two eggs, a little orange
flour water, a little fine Lisbon sugar, some lemon peel, and citron
sliced, and half fill the skins. Boil as before directed.
_Hogs’ Lard._
Should be carefully melted in a jar, put into a kettle of water, and
boiled and run into bladders that have been extremely well cleaned. The
smaller they are, the better the lard keeps; as after the air reaches
it, it becomes rank. Put in a sprig of rosemary when melted.
This being a most useful article for frying fish, it should be prepared
with care. Mixed with butter it makes fine crust.
_Pig’s Harslet._
Wash and dry some liver, sweetbreads, and fat and lean bits of pork;
beating the latter with a rolling pin to make it tender. Season with
pepper, salt, sage, and a little onion, shred fine. Put all when mixed
into a cawl, and fasten it up tight with a needle and thread. Roast it
on a hanging jack, or by a string. Or serve in slices with parsley for a
fry.
Serve with a sauce of port and water, and mustard just boiled up, and
put into the dish.
_Loins and Necks of Pork, roast._
Shoulders and breasts put into pickle, or salt the former as a leg.
_Rolled Neck._
Bone it. Put a forcemeat of chopped sage, a very few crumbs of bread,
salt, pepper, and two or three pimentos over the inside: then roll the
meat as tight as you can, and roast it slowly, and at a good distance at
first.
_To make a Pickle for Hams, Tongues, or Beef, if boiled and skimmed
between each parcel of them, that will keep for years._
To two gallons of spring water put two pounds of coarse sugar, two
pounds of bay, and two and a half pounds of common salt, and half a
pound of saltpetre, in a deep earthen glazed pan, that will hold four
gallons, and has a cover that will fit close. Keep the beef or hams as
long as they will bear, before you put them into the pickle, and
sprinkle them with coarse sugar in a pan, from which they must drain.
Rub the hams, &c. well with the pickle, and pack them in close, putting
as much as the pan will hold, so that the pickle may cover them. The
pickle is not to be boiled at first. A small ham may lie fourteen days,
a large one three weeks; a tongue twelve days; beef in proportion to its
size. They will eat well out of the pickle without drying. When to be
dried, let each piece be drained over the pan, and when it will drop no
longer, take a clean sponge and dry it thoroughly. Six or eight hours
will smoke them; and there should be only a little sawdust and wet straw
burnt to smoke them; but if put into a baker’s chimney, sew them in
coarse cloth, and hang them a week.
_Excellent Bacon._
When the hog is divided, if a large one, the chine should be cut out.
The bacon will be preserved from being rusty, if the spareribs are left
in. Salt the bacon six days; then drain it from the first pickle. Mix as
much salt as you judge proper with eight ounces of bay salt, four ounces
of saltpetre, and one pound of coarse sugar, to each hog, the hams being
first cut off. Rub the salts well in, and turn it every day for a month.
Drain, and smoke a few days; or dry without, by hanging in the kitchen,
not near the fire.
MUTTON. _The Haunch._
Keep as long as it can be preserved sweet, by the different modes of
keeping. Let it be washed with warm milk and water, or vinegar, if
necessary; but soak off the flavour from keeping. Put a coarse paste on
strong paper, and fold the haunch in: set it at a great distance from
the fire, and allow proportionable time for the paste, which do not
remove till about thirty five or forty minutes before serving; then
baste it perpetually. You will have brought the haunch nearer to the
fire before you take off the paste, and must froth it up as you would
venison.
A gravy must be made of a pound and a half of loin of old mutton,
simmered in a pint of water to half, and no seasoning but salt. Brown it
with a little burnt sugar, and send it up in the dish: but there should
be much gravy in the meat; for though long at the fire, the distance and
covering will prevent its being done dry.
Serve with currantjelly sauce.
Legs roasted, and onion or currantjelly sauce: or, boiled, with caper
sauce and vegetables.
Necks are particularly useful, as so many dishes may be made of them;
but they are not advantageous for the family. The bones should be cut
short; which the butchers will not do unless particularly desired.
_Note._ When there is more fat to a neck or loin of mutton than is
agreeable to eat with the lean, it makes an uncommonly good suet
pudding, or crust for a meatpie, being cut very fine.
The best end of the neck boiled, and served with turnips: or roasted: or
in steaks, in pies, or harrico.
The scrag stewed in broth, or with a small quantity of water, some small
onions, a few peppercorns and a little rice, and served together.
_Harrico._
Take off some of the fat, and cut the middle or best end of the neck
into rather thin steaks. Put the fat into a fryingpan, and, flouring,
fry them in it of a fine light brown, but not enough for eating. Put
them in a dish while you fry the carrots, turnips, and onions; the
former in dice, the latter sliced; but they must only be warmed, not
browned, or you need not fry them. Then lay the steaks at the bottom of
a stewpan, the vegetables over, and pour as much boiling water on them
as will just cover: give one boil, skim well, and then set the pan on
the side of the fire to simmer gently till tender: in three or four
hours skim, and add pepper, salt, and one spoonful of catsup.
_Mutton Pie._
Cut steaks from a loin or neck of mutton: beat them and remove some of
the fat. Season with salt, pepper, and a little onion. Put a little
water at the bottom of the dish, and a little paste on the edge; then
cover with a moderately thick paste. Or raise small pies, and, breaking
each bone in two to shorten it, season and cover it over, pinching the
edge. When they come out, pour a spoonful of gravy, made of a bit of
mutton, into each. The mutton should have hung.
_Mutton and Potatoe Pie._
Season the steaks of a loin or neck; lay them in a dish: have ready
potatoes mashed very thick, with some milk, and a bit of butter and
salt, and cover the meat as with a very thick crust, and to come on the
surrounding edge.
_Mutton Pudding._
Season as above. Lay one layer of steaks at the bottom of the dish, and
pour a batter of potatoes boiled and pressed through a colander, and
mixed with milk and an egg, over them: then putting the rest of the
steaks, and batter, bake it.
Batter with flour, instead of potatoes, eats well, but requires more
egg, and is not so good.
_Mutton Sausages._
Take a pound of the rawest part of a leg of mutton that has been either
roasted or boiled: chop it extremely small: season with pepper, salt,
mace, and nutmeg. Add six ounces of beef suet, some sweet herbs, two
anchovies, and a pint of oysters, all chopped very small; a quarter of a
pound of grated bread, some of the anchovy liquor, and all that came
from the oysters; the yelks and whites of two eggs well beaten. Put it
all, when well mixed, into a little pot, and use it by rolling it into
balls or sausage shape, and fry them. If approved, a _little_ shalot may
be added; or garlick, which is a great improvement.
_Mutton Steaks_
Should be cut from a loin or neck that has hung. If the latter, the
bones should not be long. They should be broiled on a clear fire, and
seasoned when half done, and frequently turned; when, taking into a very
hot dish, rub a bit of butter on each, and serve hot and hot the moment
they are done.
They may be covered with forcemeat.
_Mutton Collops._
Cut from that part of a well hung loin of mutton which is next the leg,
some collops very thin. Take out the sinews. Season them with salt,
pepper and mace, and strew over them shred parsley, thyme, and two or
three shalots. Fry them in butter till half done. Add half a pint of
gravy, a little juice of lemon, and a piece of butter rubbed in flour,
and simmer the whole very gently five minutes. They should be served
immediately, or they will be hard.
_Lamb Steaks._
Fry a beautiful brown. Throw over them, when served, a good quantity of
crumbs of bread fried, and crimped parsley: the receipt for doing which
of a fine colour, is given under the article of vegetables.
Mutton and Lamb steaks, seasoned and broiled in buttered papers, either
with crumbs and herbs, or without, are a genteel dish, and eat well.
Sauce for them, called sauce Robart, under the list of sauces.
Saddle or Loin of mutton, roasted: the former a fashionable dish.
Shoulder of mutton, roasted, and onion sauce. Bladebone broiled.
_Shoulder of Mutton boiled with Oysters._
Hang it some days, then salt it well for two. Bone it, and sprinkle it
with pepper, and a bit of mace pounded. Lay some oysters over it, and
roll the meat up tight with a fillet. Stew it in a small quantity of
water, with an onion, and a few peppercorns, till quite tender.
Have ready a little good gravy, and some oysters stewed in it: thicken
with flour and butter, and pour over the mutton when the tape is
removed. The stewpan should be kept close covered.
_Breast of Mutton._
The superfluous fat being cut off, roast, and serve with stewed
cucumbers: or, to eat cold, having covered it with chopped parsley: or
half boiled, and then grilled before the fire, being covered with crumbs
and herbs, and served with caper sauce: or boned, a good deal of the fat
being taken off, and covered with bread, herbs, and seasoning; then
rolled, and boiled, and served with chopped walnut, or capers and
butter.
_Rolled Loin of Mutton._
Hang the mutton, to be tender. Bone it, and lay a seasoning of pepper,
pimento, mace, nutmeg, a few cloves, all in fine powder, over it. Next
day prepare a stuffing as for a hare, beat the meat, and cover it with
the stuffing, roll it tight, and fillet it. Half bake it in a slow oven:
let it grow cold: remove the fat, and put the gravy into a stewpan:
flour the meat, and put in likewise; stew till near ready, and add a
glass of port wine, some catsup, an anchovy, and a little lemon pickle,
half an hour before serving, which do in the gravy, and with jelly
sauce. A few fresh mushrooms are a great improvement, but not if to eat
like hare, nor add the lemon pickle.
Rumps, kidneys, livers, and hearts, well washed, seasoned, and broiled,
and served with cold butter rubbed on them.
_Steaks of Mutton, or Lamb and Cucumbers._
Quarter cucumbers, and lay them in a deep dish; sprinkle them with salt,
and pour vinegar over. Fry chops of a fine brown, and put them in a
stewpan: drain the cucumbers, and put over the steaks: put some sliced
onions, pepper, and salt: pour hot water or weak broth on them: stew and
skim well.
_An excellent Hotch Potch._
Stew pease, lettuce, and onions, in a very little water, with a beef or
ham bone. While doing, fry some mutton or lamb steaks, seasoned, of a
nice brown. Three quarters of an hour before dinner put the steaks into
a stewpan, and the vegetables over: stew them, and serve all together in
a tureen.
_Another Hotch Potch._
Knuckle of veal, and scrag of mutton, stewed with vegetables as above.
_Mutton Ham._
Choose a fine grained leg of wether mutton, of twelve or fourteen pounds
weight. Let it be cut ham shape, and hang two days: then put into a
stewpan half a pound of bay salt, the same of common salt, two ounces of
saltpetre, half a pound of coarsest sugar, all in powder: mix and make
it quite hot; then rub it well into the ham, let it be turned in the
liquor daily. At the end of four days put two ounces more of common
salt: in twelve days take it out; dry, and hang it up in the wood smoke
a week.
_Mutton Cutlets in the Portuguese way._
Cut the chops, and half fry them, with sliced shalot or onion, chopped
parsley, and two bayleaves; seasoned with pepper and salt. Then lay a
forcemeat on a piece of white paper, put the chop on it, cover with
forcemeat, and twist the paper up, leaving a hole for the end of the
bones to go through. Broil on a gentle fire. Serve with sauce Robart;
or, as the seasoning makes the cutlets high, a little gravy.
_Lamb._
Leg boiled in a cloth to look as white as possible: the loin fried in
steaks and served round, garnished with dried or fried parsley. Spinach
to eat with it. Or dressed separately, or roasted.
_Lamb’s Head and Hinge._
That of a house lamb is best, but either, if soaked in cold water, will
be white. Boil the head separately till very tender, and have ready the
liver and lights cut small. After being three parts boiled, stew them in
a little of the water in which they were boiled. Season, and thicken
with flour and butter, and serve the mince round the head.
_Fore Quarter of Lamb._
Roasted whole, or separately. If left to be cold, chopped parsley should
be sprinkled over it.
_Lamb’s Fry._
Serve it fried a beautiful colour, and a good deal of dried or fried
parsley over it.
_Turkey to Boil._
Make a stuffing of bread, herbs, salt, pepper, nutmeg, lemonpeel, a few
oysters or an anchovy, a bit of butter, some suet, and an egg. Put this
in the crop, and fasten up the skin, and boil the turkey in a floured
cloth, to make it very white. Have ready a fine oyster sauce, made rich
with butter, a little cream, a spoonful of soy, if approved, and pour
over the bird. Or, liver and lemon sauce.
Hen birds are best for boiling, and should be young.
_Turkey to Roast._
The sinews of the legs should be drawn, whichever way it be dressed. The
head should be twisted under the wing; and in drawing, care should be
taken not to tear the liver, or let the gall touch it. Put a stuffing of
sausage meat; or, if sausages are to be served in the dish, a bread
stuffing. As this makes a large addition to the size of the bird,
observe that the heat of the fire be constantly to that part; for the
breast is frequently not enough done. A little strip of paper should be
put on the bone to prevent scorching, while the other parts roast. Baste
well, and froth it up. Gravy in the dish, and plenty of bread sauce in a
sauce tureen.
_Pulled Turkey._
Divide the meat of the breast by pulling instead of cutting; then warm
it in a spoonful or two of white gravy, a little cream, grated nutmeg,
salt, and a little flour and butter: warm, but do not boil it. The leg
seasoned, scored, and broiled, put in the dish, with the above round it.
Cold chicken does as well.
_Turkey Patties._
Mince some of the white parts, and with grated lemon, nutmeg, salt, a
very little white pepper, cream, and a very little bit of butter warmed.
Fill the patties; they having been first baked with a bit of bread in
each, to keep them hollow.
_Pheasants and Partridges._
Roast as turkey, and serve with a fine gravy: in which put the smallest
bit of garlick, and bread sauce. When cold, they may be made into
excellent patties, but their flavour should not be overpowered by lemon.
_Potted Partridge._
When nicely cleaned, season with the following, in finest powder: mace,
Jamaica pepper, white pepper, and salt. Rub every part well; then lay
the breasts downwards in a pan, and pack the birds as close as you
possibly can. Put a good deal of butter on them; then cover the pan with
a coarse flour paste, and a paper over: tie close and bake. When cold,
put into pots, and cover with butter.
_A very economical way of Potting Birds._
Prepare as before. When baked, and become cold, cut them in proper
pieces for helping, and pack them close into a large potting pot, and
leave, if possible, no spaces to receive the butter; with which, cover
them, and one third part less will be requisite than when done whole.
_To clarify Butter for potted things._
Put it in a sauce boat, and set that in a stewpan that has a little
water in, over the fire. When melted, observe not to pour the milky
parts over the potted things, they will sink to the bottom.
_Fowls._
Boiled, with oyster, lemon, parsley, and butter, or liver sauces; or
with bacon and greens.
_Ditto roasted._
Egg sauce, bread sauce, or garnished with sausages, scalded, and
parsley.
A large barndoor fowl well hung, stuffed in the crop with sausage meat,
and gravy in the dish, and with bread sauce.
The head should be turned under the wing.
Fowl split down the back, peppered, salted, and broiled. Serve it with
mushroom sauce.
_To boil Fowl with Rice._
Stew the fowl very slowly, in some clear mutton broth, well skimmed, and
seasoned with onion, mace, pepper, and salt. About half an hour before
it be ready, put in a quarter of a pint of rice, well washed and soaked.
Simmer till tender; then strain from the broth, and put the rice on a
sieve before the fire. Keep the fowl hot; lay it in the middle of the
dish, and the rice round it, without the _broth_; which will be very
nice to eat as such; but the less liquor it is done with the better.
_Fricassee of Chickens._
Boil them rather more than half in a small quantity of water: let them
cool; then cut them up, and put them to simmer in a little gravy, made
of the liquor they were boiled in, and a bit of veal or mutton, onion,
mace, lemonpeel, white pepper, and a bunch of sweet herbs. When quite
tender, keep them hot while you thicken the sauce thus: strain off, and
put it back into the saucepan, with a little salt, a scrape of nutmeg, a
bit of flour and butter: give it one boil; and when you are going to
serve, beat up the yelk of an egg, add half a pint of cream, and stir
them over the fire, but do not let it boil.
It will be equally good without the egg.
_Another white Sauce, more easily made._
Take a little of the water that boiled the fowls, (which must be kept
hot) and stew with it some cut onion, a bit of parsley, a blade of mace,
and a bit of lemonpeel. Mix with this a bit of butter, flour, and little
thick cream, and adding the chicken, warm it with the sauce.
The above for veal or rabbit; but if either are not sufficiently done
before, then the cream and flour should be added just before serving,
after the meat is a little stewed.
_Davenport Fowls._
Hang young fowls a night: take the livers, hearts, and tenderest parts
of the gizzards, shred very small, with half a handful of young clary,
an anchovy to each fowl, one onion, and the yelks of four eggs, boiled
hard, with pepper, salt, and mace to your taste. Stuff the fowls with
this, and sew up the vents and necks quite close, that the water may not
get in. Boil them in salt and water till near done; then drain, and put
them into a stewpan, with butter enough to brown them. Then serve with
fine melted butter, and a spoonful of catsup, of either sort, in the
dish.
_To pull Chicken._
Take off the skin, and pull the flesh off the bones of a cold fowl, in
as large pieces as you can. Dredge with flour, and fry of a nice brown
in butter; which drain from it, and simmer in a good gravy, well
seasoned, and thickened with a little flour and butter. Add the juice of
half a lemon.
_Chicken Pie._
Cut up two young fowls: season with white pepper, salt, a little mace,
and nutmeg, all in the finest powder; likewise a little Cayenne. Put the
chicken, slices of ham or gammon, forcemeat, and hard eggs, alternately.
If to be in a dish, put a little water; if in a raised crust, none.
Against the pie be baked, have ready a gravy of knuckle of veal, with a
few shank bones, seasoned with herbs, onion, mace, and pepper. If in a
dish, put in as much gravy as will fill it: if in crust, let it go cold;
then open the lid, and put in the jelly.
_The Forcemeat for Pies of Fowls of any kind._
Pound fine, cold chicken, or veal, a bit of fat bacon, some grated ham,
crumbs of bread, a very little bit of onion, parsley, knotted marjorum,
and a very small bit of tarragon, chopped fine; a blade of mace, a
little nutmeg, white pepper, and salt, in finest powder. When well
mixed, add eggs to make into balls.
_Chicken Curry._
Cut up the chickens before they are dressed, and fry them in butter,
with sliced onions, till of a fine colour: or if you use those that have
been dressed, do not fry them: lay the joints, cut in two or three
pieces each, into a stewpan, with veal or mutton gravy, a clove or two
of garlick, four large spoonfuls of cream, and some Cayenne: rub smooth
one or two spoonfuls of curry powder, with a little flour, and a bit of
butter, and add twenty minutes before you serve; stewing it on till
ready. A little juice of lemon should be squeezed in when serving.
Slices of rare done veal, rabbit, or turkey, make a good curry.
A dish of rice boiled plain, as hereafter directed, must be always
served to eat with curry.
_Another Curry, and more quickly made._
Cut up a chicken or young rabbit; if the former, take off the skin, and
rub each piece in a large spoonful of flour, mixed with half an ounce of
curry powder: slice two or three onions, and fry in butter, of a fine
light brown; then add the meat, and fry altogether, until the latter
begin to brown; then put into a stewpan, and pour boiling water over to
cover. Let it simmer very gently two or three hours until quite tender.
If too thick, put more water half an hour before it be served.
Dressed fowl or meat may be done; but the curry will be better made of
fresh.
_Grouse._
Are to be roasted like fowls; but their heads twisted under the wing,
and served with gravy, and bread sauce, or with sauce for wild fowl. See
Sauces.
_To pot Grouse, or Moor Game._
Pick, singe, and wash them very clean; then rub them inside and out with
a high seasoning of salt, pepper, mace, nutmeg, and allspice. Lay them
in as small a pot as will hold them: cover them with butter, and bake
them in a slow oven. When cold, take off the butter, move the birds from
the gravy, dry, and put them into pots that will just fit one or two;
the former, where there are not many. Melt the former butter with some
more, so as to completely cover the birds: but take care not to oil it.
Do not let it be too hot.
_To roast Widgeon, Duck, Teal, or Moorhen._
The flavour is best preserved without stuffing; but put some pepper,
salt, and a bit of butter in the birds. Wild fowl require to be much
less done than tame, and to be served of a fine colour.
The basting ordered in the foregoing receipt takes off a fishy taste
which wild fowl sometimes have. Send up a very good gravy in the dish;
and on cutting the breast, half a lemon squeezed over, with pepper on
it, improves the taste.
Or stuff them with crumbs, a little shred onion, sage, pepper, and salt,
but not a large quantity, and add a bit of butter. Slice an onion, and
put into the dripping pan, with a little salt, and baste the fowls with
it till three parts done; then remove that, and baste with butter. They
should come up finely frothed, and not be overdone.
An excellent sauce under that article.
_Duck to boil._
Choose a fine fat duck, salt it two days, then boil it slowly, and cover
it with onion sauce made very white, and the butter melted with milk
instead of water.
To roast duck: stuff or not, and serve with gravy.
_Duck Pie._
Bone a full grown young duck, and a fine young fowl of a good size.
Season them both well with mace, pepper, salt and allspice. Put the fowl
within the duck, and a calf’s tongue that has been pickled red, and
boiled, within the fowl. Make the whole to lie close. The skin of the
legs and wings should be drawn inwards, that the body may lie smooth,
Put the birds into a raised pie, or small piedish, and cover it with a
thickish paste. Bake in a slow oven to eat cold.
The old Staffordshire raised pies were made as above, but a turkey was
put over the duck, and a goose over that, forming a very large pie.
_Goose to Roast._
After being carefully picked, the plugs of the feathers pulled out, and
the hairs singed, let it be well washed, dried, and seasoned with onion,
sage, pepper, and salt; fasten it tight at the neck and vent, and roast
it.
When half done, let a narrow strip of paper be skewered on the
breastbone. Baste it well, and observe to take it up the moment it is
done, nicely frothed. When the breast rises, take off the paper, and
observe to serve it before it fall, or it will be spoiled, and come to
table flattened. Before it is cut up, cut the apron off, and pour in a
wineglass of port wine and a teaspoonful of mustard. Cut the breast from
one pinion to the other, if for a large party, without leaving meat to
the wingbone.
Gravy, and apple sauce.
_Green Goose Pie._
Bone two green geese, having first removed every plug, and singed them
nicely. Wash them clean; season high with salt, mace, pepper, and
pimento: put one within the other, and press them close into your
piedish; put a good deal of butter over them, and bake with or without a
crust: if the latter, a cover that will keep the steam in, must supply
the place of a crust. It will keep long.
_Giblet Pie._
Stew duck or goose giblets, when nicely cleaned, with onion, black
pepper, and a bunch of sweet herbs, till tender. Let them become cold;
then put them in the dish with two or three steaks of veal, beef, or
mutton, especially if there are not giblets enough to make the sized pie
that you wish. A little cup of cream, put in when baked, is a great
improvement. Put the liquor in first.
_Stewed Giblets._
As above, and add a little butter and flour. Serve with sippets, and
cream just scalded in the sauce.
_Stewed Pigeons._
Let them be fresh, and carefully cropped, drawn, and washed, then let
them soak half an hour: in the mean time cut a hard white cabbage into
water in slices as for pickling; drain it, and boil it in milk and
water; drain it again, then lay some of it at the bottom of a stewpan;
put the birds on it, being well seasoned, and cover them with the
remainder; put a little broth into them, and stew till quite tender,
before you serve. Add some cream, and a little flour and butter; give it
one boil, and serve the cabbage round the pigeons.
_Another way._
Stew in a good gravy, stuffed or not, and season well. Add a little
mushroom catsup, or fresh mushrooms.
_To pickle Pigeons._
Bone the pigeons, turn the inside out, and lard it: season with Jamaica
pepper pounded very fine, and a little salt: turn the inside outward
again, and tie the neck and rump with thread: put them in boiling water,
let them boil a minute or two to plump; take them out, and dry with a
cloth. The pickle must be made of an equal quantity of wine, and white
wine vinegar; white pepper, Jamaica pepper, sliced nutmeg, ginger, and
two or three bayleaves boiled. When it boils, put the pigeons into it,
and let them boil fifteen minutes, if small; twenty, if large. Then take
them out, wipe, and let them cool. When the pickle is cold, take off the
fat, and put them in.
They must be kept in a stonejar, tied down with a bladder to exclude the
air. You may in some, instead of larding, put a stuffing of hard yelks
of eggs, and marrow, in equal quantities, spices, and sweet herbs.
_Pigeons in Jelly._
Save some of the liquor in which a knuckle of veal has been boiled, as
likewise a calf’s foot, or else simmer some isinglass in it, a blade of
mace, an onion, a bunch of herbs, some lemonpeel, white pepper, and
salt. When the pigeons are nicely cleaned and soaked, put them in a pan,
and pour the liquor over them; and let them be baked, and remain in it
till cold. When served, put jelly over and round them. Season them as
you approve.
_Potted Pigeons._
Take fresh ones: clean them carefully: season with pepper and salt: put
them close in a small pan, and pour butter over: bake, and when cold
take them out. Put into fresh pots, fit to serve to table, two or three
in each, and pour butter over, using that which was baked with them as
part. Observe, that it is necessary to put a good deal of butter if to
be kept.
_Note._ Butter that has covered potted things is good for basting, and
will make very good paste for meatpies. If to be high, add some mace,
and a few Jamaica peppers to the seasoning.
_Pigeon Pie._
Clean as before: season; and, if approved, put some parsley into the
birds, and a bit of butter, with pepper and salt. Lay a beefsteak at the
bottom of the dish, and hard eggs between each two birds, and a little
water. If you have ham in the house, lay a slice on each: it is a great
improvement to the flavour.
Observe, when you cut ham for sauce or pies, to turn it, and take from
the underside instead of the prime.
_Broiled Pigeons._
Slit them down the back: season, and broil. Serve with mushroom sauce;
or melted butter, with a little mushroom catsup.
_Roast Pigeons._
Should be stuffed with uncut parsley, seasoned; and served with parsley
and butter. Asparagus, or peas, should be dressed to eat with them.
_Parsley Pie._
Lay veal or fowl at the bottom of a pie dish, seasoned. Take a colander
full of picked parsley, cover the meat with it, and pour some cream into
the dish, and a spoonful or two of broth. Cover with crust.
_Potatoe Pasty._
Boil, peel, and mash potatoes as fine as possible; then mix pepper,
salt, and a little thick cream, or, if you prefer it, butter. Make a
paste, and, rolling it out like a large puff, put the potatoe into it,
and bake it.
_Turnip Pie._
Season mutton chops with pepper and salt: lay them in the bottom of a
dish, reserving the ends of the bones to lay over the turnips; which cut
and season, and lay over the steaks till the dish be full. Put two or
three spoonfuls of water in, and cover with crust. You may add a little
onion.
_Shrimp Pie. Excellent._
Take a quart of picked shrimps: if very salt, only season with mace, and
a clove or two in fine powder; but if not salt, mince two or three
anchovies, mix with the spice, and season them. Put some butter at the
bottom of the dish, and over the shrimps, and a glass of sharp white
wine. Put a good light paste over. They do not require long baking.
_Cornish Pies._
Scald and blanch some broad beans: cut mushrooms, carrots, turnips, and
artichoke bottoms, and with some peas, and a little onion, make the
whole into a nice stew, with some good veal gravy. Bake a crust over a
dish, with a little lining round the edge, and a cup within to keep it
from sinking: open the lid, and put in the fricassee made hot; seasoning
to your taste. Shalots, parsley, lettuce, celery, or any sort of
vegetables that you like, may be added.
_Fish Pie._
Put slices of cod that have been salted a night; pepper, and between
each layer put a good quantity of parsley picked from the stalks, and
some fresh butter. Pour a little broth, if you have any, or else a
little water. Bake the pie; and when to be served, add a quarter of a
pint of raw cream warm, with half a teaspoonful of flour. Oysters may be
added.
Mackerel will do well; but do not salt it till used.
Soals, with oysters, seasoned with pounded mace, nutmeg, pepper, an
anchovy, and some salt, make an excellent pie. Put in the oyster liquor,
two or three spoonfuls of broth, and some butter, for gravy. When come
from the oven, pour in a cup of thick cream.
_To prepare Meat or Fowls for raised Pies._
When washed, put a good seasoning of spices and salt. Set it over a fire
in a stewpan, that will just hold the meat: put a piece of butter, and,
covering close, let it simmer in its own steam till it shrink. It must
be cool before it be put into the pie. Chicken’s sweetbreads, giblets,
pigeon’s meat, almost any thing will make a good pie, if well seasoned,
and made tender by stewing. A forcemeat may be put under and over, of
cold chicken or veal, fat bacon, shred ham, herbs, bread, and seasoning,
bound with an egg or two, or in balls. Or instead of crust, use an
earthen pie form.
_Hares_,
If old, should be larded with bacon, after having hung as long as they
will keep, and being first soaked in pepper and vinegar.
If not paunched as soon as killed, hares are more juicy: but as that is
usually done in the field, the cook must be careful to wipe it dry every
day; the liver being removed, and boiled to keep for the stuffing.
Parsley put into the belly will help keep it fresh.
When to be dressed, the hare must be well soaked; and if the neck and
shoulders are bloody, in warm water: then dry it, and put to it a large
fine stuffing, made of the liver, an anchovy, some fat bacon, a little
suet, herbs, spice, and bread crumbs, with an egg to bind it. Sew it up.
Observe that the ears are nicely cleaned and singed. When half roasted,
cut the skin off the neck to let out the blood, which afterwards fixes
there. Baste with milk till three parts done, then with butter: and
before served, froth it up with flour. It should be put down early, kept
at a great distance at first from the fire, and drawn nearer by degrees.
Send a rich brown gravy in the dish; melted butter in one boat, and
currantjelly in another.
_To jug an old Hare._
After it is well cleaned and skinned, cut it up and season it with
pepper, allspice, salt, pounded, mace, and a little nutmeg: put it into
a jar, with an onion, a clove or two, a bunch of sweet herbs, and over
all a bit of coarse beef. Tie it down with a bladder and leather quite
close, and put the jar into a saucepan of water up to its neck, but no
higher. Let the water boil gently five hours. When to be served, pour
the gravy into a saucepan, and thicken it with butter and flour; or if
become cold, warm the hare with the gravy.
_Hare Soup._ See _Soups_.
_Hare Pie._
Season the hare after it is cut up. Put eggs, and forcemeat, and either
bake in a raised crust or a dish: if in the former, put cold jelly gravy
to it; if for the latter, the same hot; but the pie is to be eaten cold.
See _Jelly Gravy among similar articles_.
_Potted Hare._
Having seasoned, and baked it with butter over, cover it with brown
paper, and let it grow cold. Then take the meat from the bones, beat it
in a mortar, and add salt, mace, and pepper, if not high enough; a bit
of fresh butter melted, and a spoonful of the gravy that came from the
hare when baked. Put the meat into small pots, and cover it well with
butter warmed. The prime should be baked at the bottom of the pot.
_Broiled Hare and hashed._
The flavour of broiled hare is particularly fine. The legs or wings
peppered and salted first, and when done, rubbed with cold butter.
The other parts warmed with the gravy and a little stuffing.
_Rabbits_
May be eaten various ways.
Roasted with stuffing and gravy.
Ditto without stuffing; and with liver, parsley, and butter: seasoned
with pepper and salt.
Boiled, and smothered with onion sauce; the butter being melted with
milk instead of water.
Fried, and served with dried or fried parsley, and liver sauce as above.
Fricasseed, as directed for chickens.
Made into Pies, as chickens, with forcemeat, &c. are excellent, when
young.
_To make Rabbit taste much like_ Hare.
Choose a young full grown one: hang it, with the skin on, two or three
days: skin, and lay it unwashed in a seasoning of black and Jamaica
peppers, in fine powder, putting some port wine into the dish, and baste
it occasionally for forty hours: then stuff and roast it as hare, and
with the same sauce. Do not wash off the liquor that it lay in.
_Potted Rabbit._
Cut up and season three or four after washing them. The seasoning must
be mace, pepper, salt, a little Cayenne, and a few pimentos in finest
powder. Pack them as close as possible in a small pan, and make the
surface smooth. Keep out the carcasses, having taken all the meat off
them, and, putting a good deal of butter over the rabbits, bake them
gently. Let them remain a day or two, then remove into potting pans; and
add some fresh butter to that which already covers them.
SOUPS.
_Giblet Soup._
Scald and clean three or four sets of goose or duck giblets; then set
them on to stew with a scrag of mutton, or a pound of gravy beef, or
bone of knuckle of veal, an oxtail, or some shankbones of mutton; three
onions, a blade of mace, ten peppercorns, two cloves, a bunch of sweet
herbs, and two quarts of water. Simmer till the gizzards are quite
tender, which must be cut in three or four parts; then put in a little
cream, a spoonful of flour rubbed smooth with it, and a spoonful of
mushroom catsup; or two glasses of sherry or Madeira wine instead of
cream, and some Cayenne.
_Turnip Soup._
Stew down a knuckle of veal: strain, and let the broth stand still next
day; take off the fat and sediment, and warm it, adding turnips cut in
small dice: stew till they are tender: put a bit of pounded mace, white
pepper, and salt. Before you serve, rub down half a spoonful of flour,
with half a pint of cream, and boil with the soup: pour it on a roll in
the tureen; but it should have soaked a little first in the soup, which
should be as thick as middling cream.
_Old Peas Soup._
Save the water of boiled pork or beef: if too salt, use only a part, and
the other of plain water: or put some roast beef bones, or a ham or
bacon bone to give a relish; or an anchovy or two. Set these on with
some good whole or split peas, the smaller quantity of water at first
the better: simmer till the peas will pulp through a colander; then set
that, and some more of the liquor, besides what boiled the peas, some
carrots, turnips, celery, and onion, or a leak or two, to stew till all
be tender. Celery will take less time, and may be put in an hour before
dinner. When ready, put fried bread in dice, dried mint rubbed small,
pepper, and, if wanted, salt, in the tureen, and pour the soup upon
them.
_Green Peas Soup._
In shelling, divide the old from the young, and put the former, with a
bit of butter, and a little water into a stewpan, and the old parts of
lettuce, an onion or two, a little pepper and salt. Simmer till the peas
will pulp through a colander; which when done, add to it some more
water, and that which boiled the peas, the best parts of the lettuce,
and the young peas, a handful of spinach cut small, pepper, and salt to
taste. Stew till the vegetables are quite tender; and a few minutes
before serving, throw in some green mint, cut fine.
Should the soup be too thin, a spoonful of rice flour, rubbed down with
a bit of butter, and boiled with it, will give it consistence.
_Note._ If soup or gravy be too weak, the cover of the saucepan should
be taken off, and the steam let out, boiling it very quick.
When there is plenty of vegetables, green peas soup needs no meat: but
if approved, a pig’s foot, or a small bit of any sort, may be boiled
with the old peas, and removed into the second process till the juices
shall be obtained. Observe, three or four ounces of butter, will supply
richness to a soup without meat, or make it higher with it.
_Gravy Soup._
Wash a leg of beef, break the bone, and set it over the fire with five
quarts of water, a large bunch of herbs, two onions, sliced and fried,
but not burnt, a blade or two of mace, three cloves, twenty Jamaica
peppers, and forty black. Simmer till the soup be as rich as you choose;
then strain off the meat, which will be fit for the servants’ table.
Next day take off the cake of fat, and that will warm with vegetables;
or make a piecrust for the same. Have ready such vegetables as you
choose to serve, cut in dice, carrot, and turnip, sliced, and simmer
till tender. Celery should be stewed in it likewise; and before you
serve, boil some vermicelli long enough to be tender, which it will be
in fifteen minutes. Add a spoonful of soy, and one of mushroom catsup.
Some people do not serve the vegetables, only boil for the flavour. A
small roll should be made hot, and kept long enough in the saucepan to
swell, and then be sent up in the tureen.
_A rich White Soup._
Boil in a small quantity of water a knuckle of Veal, and scrag of
mutton, mace, white pepper, two or three onions, and sweet herbs, the
day before you want the soup. Next day take off the fat, and put the
jelly into a saucepan, with a quarter of a pound of sweet almonds
blanched, and beaten to a paste in a mortar with a little water to
prevent oiling, and put to it apiece of stale white bread, or crumb of a
roll; a bit of cold veal, or white of chicken. Beat these all to a paste
with the almond paste, and boil it a few minutes with a pint of raw
thick cream, a bit of fresh lemonpeel, and half a blade of mace pounded;
then add this thickening to the soup. Let it boil up and strain it into
the tureen: if not salt enough, then put it in. If macaroni or
vermicelli be served, they should be boiled in the soup, and the
thickening be strained after being mixed with a part. A small rasped
roll may be put in.
Instead of the cream thickening, as above, ground rice, and a little
cream may be used.
_A plainer White Soup._
Of a small knuckle of veal, two or three pints of soup may be made, with
seasoning as before, and both served together, with the addition of a
quarter of a pint of good milk.
_An excellent Soup._
A scrag or knuckle of veal, slices of undressed gammon, onions, mace,
and a small quantity of water, simmered till very strong, and lower it
with a good beef broth made the day before, and stewed until the meat is
done to rags. Add cream, vermicelli, almonds as before, and a roll.
_Carrot Soup._
Put some beef bones, with four quarts of the liquor in which a leg of
mutton or beef has been boiled, two large onions, one turnip, pepper and
salt, into a saucepan, and stew for three hours. Have ready six large
carrots, cut thin after they are scraped; strain the soup on them, and
stew till soft enough to pulp through a hair sieve or coarse cloth: then
boil the pulp with the soup; which is to be as thick as pea ssoup. Use
two wooden spoons to rub the carrots through. Make the soup the day
before it is to be used. Add Cayenne.
_Onion Soup._
To the water that has boiled a leg or neck of mutton, put carrots,
turnips, and, if you have one, a shankbone, and simmer till the juices
are obtained. Strain it on six onions previously sliced, and fried a
light brown; with which simmer it three hours. Skim it carefully, and
serve it. Put into it a little roll or fried bread.
_Vegetable Soup._
Pare and slice five or six cucumbers, the inside of as many cos
lettuces, a sprig or two of mint, two or three onions, some pepper and
salt, a pint and half of young peas, and a little parsley. Put these,
with half a pound of fresh butter, into a saucepan to stew in their own
liquor near a gentle fire half an hour; then pour two quarts of boiling
water to the vegetables, and stew them two hours: rub down a little
flour into a teacup of water; boil it with the rest fifteen or twenty
minutes, and serve it.
_Another Vegetable Soup._
Peel and slice six large onions, six potatoes, six carrots, and four
turnips: fry them in half a pound of butter: pour on them four quarts of
boiling water, and toast a crust of bread as brown and hard as possible,
but do not burn it: put that, some celery, sweet herbs, white pepper and
salt, to the above: stew gently four hours, strain through a coarse
cloth: have ready sliced carrot, celery, and a little turnip, and add to
your liking; and stew them tender in the soup. If approved, you may add
an anchovy, and a spoonful of catsup.
_Spinach Soup._
Shred two handfuls of spinach, a turnip, two onions, a head of celery,
two carrots, and a little thyme and parsley. Put all into a stewpot,
with, a bit of butter the size of a walnut, and a pint of broth, or the
water in which meat has been boiled; stew till the vegetables are quite
tender: work them through a coarse cloth or sieve with a spoon; then
with the pulp of the vegetables, and liquor, a quart of fresh water,
pepper and salt, boil all together. Have ready some suet dumplings, the
size of a walnut, and before you put the soup into the tureen, put them
into it. The suet must not be shred too fine; and take care that it is
perfectly fresh.
_Scotch Leek Soup._
Put the boiling of a leg of mutton into a stew pot, with a quantity of
chopped leeks, and pepper and salt; simmer them an hour, then mix some
oatmeal with a little cold water quite smooth, pour it into the soup,
and setting it on a slow part of the fire, let it simmer gently; but
take care that it does not burn to the bottom.
_Hare Soup._
Take an old hare that is good for nothing else than soup, cut in pieces,
and put it with a pound and a half of lean beef, two or three shankbones
of mutton well cleaned, a slice of lean bacon or ham; an onion, and a
bunch of sweet herbs: pour on it two quarts of boiling water: cover the
jar, in which you put these, with bladder and paper, and set it in a
kettle of water: simmer till the hare is stewed to pieces: strain off
the liquor, and give it one boil, with an anchovy cut in pieces, and add
a spoonful of soy, and a little Cayenne and salt. A few fine forcemeat
balls, fried of a good brown, should be served in the tureen.
_Scotch Mutton Broth._
Soak a neck of mutton in water for an hour: cut off the scrag, and put
into a stewpot with two quarts of water: as soon as it boils, skim it
well and simmer it an hour and a half; then take the best end of the
mutton, cut it into pieces, two bones in each, and put as many as you
think proper, having cut off some of the fat. Skim it the moment the
fresh meat boils up, and every quarter of an hour. Have ready four or
five carrots, the same of turnips, and three onions, all cut, but not
small, and put in time enough to be quite tender; two large spoonfuls of
Scotch barley, first wetted with cold water. The meat should stew three
hours. Salt to taste, and serve all together. Twenty minutes before
serving, put in some chopped parsley.
It is an excellent winter dish.
_Soups under the articles of their respective Meats._
Oxcheek Soup. Hessian Soup. Mock turtle, page 49 to 52.
_Ox rump Soup._
Two or three rumps of beef, will make it stronger than a much larger
proportion of meat without; and form a very nourishing soup.
Make it like gravy soup, and give it what flavour or thickening you
like.
_Soup A-la-sap._
Boil half a pound of grated potatoes, one pound of beef sliced thin, one
pint of grey peas, one onion, and three ounces of rice, in six pints of
water to five; strain it through a colander, then pulp the peas to it,
and turn it into a saucepan again, with two heads of celery sliced: stew
it tender, adding pepper and salt; and when you serve, fried bread.
_Crawfish or Prawn Soup._
Boil six whitings, and a large eel; or the latter, and half a thornback,
being well cleaned, with as much water as will cover them. Skim clean,
and put in whole pepper, mace, ginger, parsley, an onion, a little
thyme, and three cloves. Boil to a mash. Pick fifty crawfish, or a
hundred prawns, pound the shells, and a little roll, after having boiled
them with a little water, vinegar, salt and herbs. Pour this liquor over
the shells in a sieve, then pour the other soup, clear from the
sediment; chop a lobster, and add to it, with a quart of good beef
gravy. Add the tails of the crawfish or the prawns, and some flour and
butter; and season as necessary.
_Portable Soup. A very useful thing._
Boil one or two knuckles of veal, one or two shins of beef, and a pound
or more of fine juicy beef, in as much water only as will cover them.
When the bones are cracked, out of which take the marrow, put any sort
of spice you like, and three large onions. When the meat is done to
rags, strain it off, and put in a _very_ cold place. When cold, take off
the cake of fat (which will make crust for servants’ pies), put the soup
into a double bottom tin saucepan, set it on a pretty quick fire, but do
not let it burn. It must boil fast, and uncovered, and be stirred
constantly for eight hours; Put into a pan, and let it stand in a cold
place a day; then pour it into a round soup China dish, and set the dish
into a stewpan of boiling water on a stove, and let it boil, and be
occasionally stirred, till the soup become thick and ropy; then it is
enough. Pour it into the little round part at the bottom of cups or
basons to form cakes; and when cold, turn them out on flannel to dry,
and wrap them in it. Keep them in tin canisters. When to be used, melt
in boiling water: and if you wish the flavour of herbs or any thing
else, boil it first, and having strained the water, melt the soup in it.
This is very convenient for a bason of soup or gravy in the country, or
at sea, where fresh meat is not always at hand.
_Clear Gravy._
Slice beef thin: broil a part of it, over a very clear quick fire, just
enough to give colour to the gravy, but not to dress it: put that, and
the raw into a very nicely tinned stewpan, with two onions, a clove, or
two Jamaica and black peppers, and a bunch of sweet herbs: cover it with
hot water; give it one boil, and skim it well two or three times: then
cover it and simmer till quite strong.
_To draw Gravy that will keep a week._
Cut thin lean beef: put it in a fryingpan without any butter: set it on
a fire covered, but take care it does not burn: let it stay till all the
gravy that comes out of the meat be dried up into it again; then put as
much water as will cover the meat, and let that stew away. Then put to
the meat a small quantity of water, herbs, onions, spice, a bit of lean
ham: simmer till it is rich, then keep it in a cool place. Remove the
fat only when going to be used.
_A rich Gravy._
Cut beef in thin slices, according to the quantity wanted: slice onions
thin, and flour both: fry them of a light pale brown, but on no account
suffer them to go black: put them into a stewpan, and pouring boiling
water on the browning in the fryingpan, boil it up, and pour on the
meat. Put to it a bunch of parsley, thyme, savory, and a small bit of
knotted marjorum, and the same of tarragon, some mace, Jamaica and black
peppers, a clove or two, and a bit of ham or gammon. Simmer till you
have all the juices of the meat; and be sure to skim the moment it
boils, and frequently after. If for a hare, or stewed fish, anchovy
should be added.
The shankbones of mutton are a great improvement to the richness of the
gravy; being first well soaked, and scoured clean.
_Note._ Jelly gravy for cold pies should be brown or white, as the meat
or fowl is. It must be drawn without frying, relished, and made quite
clean, by running it through a flannel bag. To give it the consistence
of jelly, shanks, or knuckle, or feet, should be boiled with the bones.
_Jelly to cover cold Fish._
Clean a maid: put it with three quarts of water, an ounce and a half of
isinglass, a bit of mace, lemonpeel, white peppers, a stick of
horseradish, and a little ham or gammon. Stew, till on trying with a
spoon you find that it jellies: then strain it off, and add to it the
whites of five eggs, a glass of sherry wine, and the juice of a lemon;
give it another boil, and pour it through a jellybag till quite
transparent.
When cold, lay it over the fish with a spoon.
_Cullis, or brown Sauce._
Lay as much lean veal over the bottom of a stewpan as will cover it an
inch thick: then cover the veal with thin slices of undressed gammon,
two or three onions, two or three bayleaves, some sweet herbs, two
blades of mace, and three cloves. Cover the stewpan, and set it over a
slow fire. When the juices come out, let the fire be a little quicker.
When the meat is of a fine brown, fill the pan with good beef broth,
boil and skim it, then simmer an hour: add a little water, mixed with as
much flour as will make it properly thick; boil it half an hour, and
strain it.
This will keep a week.
_Veal Gravy._
Make as directed for the cullis, leaving out the spice, herbs, and
flour. It should be drawn very slowly: and if for white dishes, do not
let the meat brown.
_Bechamel or White Sauce._
Cut lean veal in small slices, and the same quantity of lean bacon or
ham: put them in a stewpan, with a good piece of butter, an onion, a
blade of mace, a few mushroom buttons, a bit of thyme, and a bayleaf.
Fry the whole over a very slow fire, but not to brown it: add flour to
thicken; then put an equal quantity of good broth, and rich cream. Let
it boil half an hour, stirring it all the time: strain it through a soup
strainer.
N. B. Soups and gravies are far better by putting the meat at the bottom
of the pan, and stewing it, and the herbs, roots, &c. with butter, than
by adding the water to the meat at first; and the gravy that is drawn
from the meat, should be nearly dried up before the water is put to it.
Do not use the sediment of gravies, &c. that have stood to be cold. When
onions are strong, boil a turnip with them, if for sauce, which will
make them mild.
_Sauce for Wild Fowl._
Simmer ten minutes a teacupful of port wine, the same of good meat
gravy, a little shalot, a little pepper, salt, a grate of nutmeg, and a
bit of mace: put a bit of butter and flour: give one boil, and pour
through the birds; which in general are not stuffed as tame, but may be
done so, if liked.
_Another for the same, or Ducks._
Serve a rich gravy in the dish: cut the breast in slices, but do not
take them off; cut a lemon, and put pepper and salt on it; then squeeze
it on the breast, and pour a spoonful of gravy over before you help.
_Note._ In cutting up any wild fowl, duck, goose, or turkey for a large
party, if you cut the slices down from pinion to pinion, without making
wings, there will be more prime pieces.
_Sauce Robart for Rumps or Steaks._
Put into a saucepan a piece of butter the size of an egg: set it over
the fire, and when browning, throw in a handful of sliced onions cut
small: fry them brown, but do not let them burn: add half a spoonful of
flour, shake the onions in it, give another fry, then put four spoonfuls
of gravy, pepper, and salt, and boil gently ten minutes. Skim off the
fat: add a teaspoonful of made mustard, a spoonful of vinegar, and half
a lemon juice: boil, and pour round the steaks, which should be of a
fine yellow brown, and garnished with fried parsley and lemon.
_An Excellent Sauce for Carp or boiled Turkey._
Rub half a pound of butter with a teaspoonful of flour; put to it a
_little_ water, melt it, and add near a quarter of a pint of thick
cream, and half an anchovy chopped fine, unwashed; set it over the fire,
and as it boils up, add a large spoonful of real India soy. If that does
not give it a fine colour, put a little more. Turn it into the sauce
tureen, and put some salt, and half a lemon. Stir it well to prevent
curdling.
_Sauce for cold Fowl or Partridge._
Rub down in a mortar the yelks of two eggs boiled hard, an anchovy, two
dessert spoonfuls of oil, a little shalot, and a teaspoonful of mustard,
(all should be pounded before the oil be added) then strain it.
_Vinagret for cold Fowl or Meat._
Chop fine mint, parsley, and shalot, and add salt, oil, and vinegar. It
may be poured over, or sent in a boat.
_Benton Sauce for hot or cold roast Beef._
Grate, or scrape very fine, horseradish, a little made mustard, some
pounded white sugar, and four large spoonfuls of vinegar.
Serve in a saucer.
_To melt Butter._
On a clean trencher, mix a little flour to a large piece of butter, in
the proportion of a teaspoonful to a full quarter of a pound; then put
into a saucepan, and pour on it two large spoonfuls of hot water; set it
on the fire, and let it boil quick. You should stir it round one way,
and serve it as soon as ready.
On the goodness of this depends the look and flavour of every sauce in
which it is put.
_Lobster Sauce._
Pound the spawn, and two anchovies: pour on two spoonfuls of gravy:
strain it into some butter melted as above; then put in the meat of the
lobster, give one boil, and add a squeeze of lemon.
_Another way._
Leave out the anchovies and gravy, and do as above, with a little salt,
and catsup, or not, as you like. Many prefer the flavour of the lobster
and salt only.
_Shrimp Sauce._
If not picked at home, pour a little water over to wash, and put them to
butter melted thick and smooth: give them one boil, and add the juice of
lemon.
_Anchovy Sauce._
Chop one or two without washing: put to some flour and butter, and a
little drop of water: stir it over the fire till it boil once or twice.
When the anchovies are good, they will be dissolved; and the colour will
be better than by the usual way.
_Fish Sauce without Butter._
Simmer very gently a quarter of a pint of vinegar, half a pint of water
(which must not be hard) with an onion, half a handful of horseradish,
and the following spices lightly bruised: four cloves, two blades of
mace, and half a teaspoonful of black pepper. When the onion is quite
tender, chop it small with two anchovies: and set the whole on the fire
to boil for a few minutes, with a spoonful of catsup. Mean time, have
ready and well beaten the yelks of three fresh eggs: strain; mix in the
liquor by degrees with them; and when well mixed, set the saucepan over
a gentle fire, keeping a bason in one hand, into which toss the sauce to
and fro, shaking the saucepan over the fire, that the eggs may not
curdle. Do not boil, only let the sauce be hot enough to give the
thickness of melted butter.
_Lemon Sauce._
Cut thin slices of lemon into very small dice, and put into melted
butter; give one boil, and pour over boiled fowls.
_Liver Sauce._
Chop boiled liver of rabbits or fowls, and do as above, with a very
little pepper and salt, and some parsley.
_A very good Sauce, especially to hide the bad colour of Fowls._
Cut the livers, slices of lemon in dice, scalded parsley, and hard eggs:
add salt, and mix with butter: boil up, and pour over the fowls.
Or for roast rabbit.
_Egg Sauce._
Boil the eggs hard, and cut them in small pieces: then put them to
melted butter.
_Buttered Eggs._
Beat four or five eggs, yelk and white together: put a quarter of a
pound of butter in a bason and then put that in boiling water; stir it
till melted: then pour that butter and the eggs into a saucepan. Keep a
bason in your hand: just hold the saucepan in the other over a slow part
of the fire, shaking it one way; as it begins to warm, pour it into a
bason, and back; then hold it again over the fire, stirring it
constantly in the saucepan, and pouring it into the bason, more
perfectly to mix the egg and butter, until they shall be hot without
boiling.
Serve on toasted bread; or in a bason to eat with salt fish or red
herrings.
_Onion Sauce._
Peel, and boil onions tender: squeeze the water from them; then chop,
and add butter that has been melted rich and smooth as before, but with
a little good milk instead of water: boil up once, and serve for boiled
rabbits, partridges, scrag, or knuckle of veal; or roast mutton.
_Oyster Sauce._
Save the liquor in opening, and boil with the beards, a bit of mace, and
lemonpeel. Mean time throw the oysters into cold water, and drain it
off. Strain the liquor, and put it into a saucepan with them, and as
much butter, mixed with a little milk, as will make sauce enough; a
little flour being previously rubbed with it.
Set them over the fire, stir all the time; and when the butter has
boiled once or twice, take them off, and keep the saucepan near, but not
on the fire; for if done too much, the oysters will be hard. Squeeze a
little lemonjuice, and serve.
If for company, a little cream is a great improvement. Observe the
oysters will thin the sauce, and put butter accordingly.
_Bread Sauce._
Boil a large onion, cut in four, with some black peppers, and milk,
until the former be quite a pap. Pour the milk strained on grated white
stale bread, and cover it. In an hour put it into a saucepan, with a
good piece of butter, mixed with a little flour: boil the whole up
together, and serve.
Some people like the bread pulped through a colander before the butter
be added. A large spoonful of cream improves it.
_Little Eggs for Pies or Turtles._
Boil three eggs hard: beat the yelks fine with the raw yelk of an egg;
then make up the paste into small eggs, and throw them into a little
boiling water to harden.
_Fish Sauce A-la-Craster._
Thicken a quarter of a pound of butter with flour, and brown it; then
put to it a pound of the best anchovies, cut small, six blades of
pounded mace, ten cloves, forty black and Jamaica peppers, a few small
onions, a faggot of sweet herbs; namely, savory, thyme, basil, and
knotted marjorum; a little parsley, and sliced horseradish. On these
pour half a pint of the best sherry wine, and a pint and a half of
strong gravy: simmer all gently for twenty minutes; then strain it
through a sieve, and bottle it for use: the way of which, is to boil
some of it in the butter, as melting.
_A very fine Fish Sauce._
Put into a very nice tin saucepan, a pint of fine port wine, one gill of
mountain, half a pint of walnut catsup that is fine, twelve anchovies,
and the liquor that belongs to them, one gill of walnut pickle, the rind
and juice of a large lemon, four or five shalots, Cayenne to taste,
three ounces of scraped horseradish, three blades of mace, and two
teaspoonfuls of made mustard: boil gently, till the rawness go off, then
put it in small bottles for use.
Cork very close, and seal the top.
_Camp Vinegar._
Slice a large head of garlick, and put it into a widemouthed bottle,
with half an ounce of Cayenne, two teaspoonfuls of real soy, two of
walnut catsup, four anchovies chopped, a pint of vinegar, of cochineal
enough to give the colour of lavender drops. Let it stand six weeks,
then strain off quite clear, and keep in small bottles, sealed up.
_Lemon Pickle._
Wipe six lemons: cut each into eight pieces: put on them a pound of
salt, six large cloves of garlick, two ounces of horseradish, sliced
thin; likewise of cloves, mace, nutmeg, and Cayenne, a quarter of an
ounce each, and two ounces of flour of mustard; to these put two quarts
of vinegar: boil a quarter of an hour in a well tinned saucepan, or
which is better, do it in a strong jar, in a kettle of boiling water, or
set the jar on the hot hearth till done. Set the jar by, and stir it
daily for six weeks. Keep the jar close covered. Put into small bottles.
_Shalot Vinegar._
Split six or eight shalots: put them into a quart bottle: fill it up
with vinegar: stop it; and in a month it will be fit for use.
_Essence of Anchovies._
Take a dozen of anchovies, chop them, and without the bone, but with
some of their own liquor strained: add them to sixteen large spoonfuls
of water: boil gently till dissolved, which will be in a few minutes.
When cold, strain and bottle it.
_Mushroom Catsup._
Take the largest broad mushrooms, break them into an earthen pan, strew
salt over, and stir them now and then for three days. Then let them
stand for twelve, till there is a thick scum over. Strain, and boil the
liquor with Jamaica and black peppers, mace, ginger, a clove or two, and
some mustardseed. When cold, bottle it, and tie a bladder over the cork.
In three months boil it again with some fresh spice, and it will then
keep a twelvemonth.
_Mushroom Catsup, another way._
Take a stewpan full of the large flap mushrooms, that are not wormeaten,
and the skins and fringe of those you have picked; throw a handful of
salt among them, and set them by a slow fire. They will produce a great
deal of liquor, which you must strain; and put to it four ounces of
shalots, two cloves of garlick, a good deal of pepper, ginger, mace,
cloves, and a few bayleaves. Boil and skim very well. When cold, cork
close. In two months boil it up again, with a little fresh spice, and a
stick of horseradish, and it will then keep the year; which mushroom
catsup rarely does, if not boiled a second time.
_Walnut Catsup of the finest sort._
Boil a gallon of the expressed juice of walnuts when they are tender,
and skim it well: then put in two pounds of anchovies, bones and liquor,
ditto of shalots, one ounce of cloves, ditto of mace, ditto of pepper,
and one clove of garlick. Let all simmer till the shalots sink; then put
the liquor into a pan till cold. Bottle, and divide the spice to each.
Cork closely, and tie a bladder over.
It will keep twenty years, and is not good the first. Be very careful to
express the juice at home; for it is rarely unadulterated, if bought.
Some people make liquor of the outside shell when the nut is ripe; but
neither the flavour nor colour is then so fine.
_Cockle Catsup._
Open the cockles: scald them in their own liquor: add a little water
when the liquor settles, if you have not enough: strain through a cloth,
then season with every savory spice; and if for brown sauce, add port
wine, anchovies, and garlick; if for white, omit these, and put a glass
of sherry wine, lemonjuice and peel, mace, nutmeg, and white pepper. If
for brown, burn a bit of sugar for colouring.
It is better to have cockles enough, than to add water; and they are
cheap.
_Mushroom Powder._
Wash half a peck of large mushrooms while quite fresh, and free them
from grit and dirt with flannel. Scrape out the black part clean, and do
not use any that are wormeaten: put them into a stewpan over the fire
without water, with two large onions, some cloves, a quarter of an ounce
of mace, and two spoonfuls of white pepper, all in powder. Simmer and
shake them till all the liquor be dried up, but be careful they do not
burn. Lay them on tins or sieves in a slow oven, till they are dry
enough to beat to powder; then put the powder in small bottles, corked
and tied closely, and keep in a dry place.
A teaspoonful will give a very fine flavour to any soup or gravy, or any
sauce; and it is to be added just before serving, and one boil given to
it after it is put in.
_To dry Mushrooms._
Wipe them clean; and of the large take out the brown, and peel off the
skin. Lay them on paper to dry in a cool oven, and keep them in paper
bags in a dry place. When used, simmer them in the gravy, and they will
swell to near their former size. To simmer them in their own liquor till
it dry up into them, shaking the pan, then drying on tin plates, is a
good way, with spice or not, as above, before made into powder.
Tie down with bladder, and keep in a dry place, or in paper.
_Sugar Vinegar._
To every gallon of water, put two pounds of the very coarsest sugar:
boil and skim thoroughly; then put one quart of cold water for every
gallon of hot. When _cool_, put into it a toast spread with yeast. Stir
it nine days; then barrel, and set it in a place where the sun will lie
on it, with a bit of slate on the bunghole.
When sufficiently sour, it may be bottled: or may be used from the cask,
with a wooden spigot and faucet.
_Gooseberry Vinegar._
Boil spring water; and when cold, put to every three quarts, a quart of
bruised ripe gooseberries in a large tub. Let them remain sixty hours,
stirring often: then strain through a hair bag, and to each gallon of
liquor add a pound of the coarsest sugar. Put it into a barrel, and a
toast and yeast, cover the bunghole with a bit of slate, &c. as above.
The greater quantity of sugar and fruit, the stronger the vinegar.
_Wine Vinegar._
After making raisin wine, when the fruit has been strained, lay it on a
heap to heat: then to every hundred weight put fifteen gallons of water.
Set the cask, and put yeast, &c. as before.
As vinegar is so necessary an article in a family, and one on which so
great a profit is made, a barrel or two might always be kept preparing,
according to what suited. If the raisins of wine were ready, that kind
might be made: if a great plenty of gooseberries made them cheap, that
sort; or if neither, then the sugar vinegar, so that the cask may not be
left empty, and grow musty.
_Kitchen Pepper._
Mix in the finest powder, one ounce of ginger; of cinnamon, black
pepper, nutmeg, and Jamaica pepper, half an ounce of each; ten cloves,
and six ounces of salt. Keep it in a bottle. It is an agreeable addition
to any brown sauces or soups.
Spice in powder, kept in small bottles, close stopped, goes much further
than when used whole. It must be dried before pounded; and should be
done in quantities that may be wanted in three or four months. Nutmeg
need not be done; but the others should be kept in separate bottles,
with a little label on each.
_Browning, to colour and flavour made dishes._
Beat to powder four ounces of doubly refined sugar: put it into a very
nice iron fryingpan, with one ounce of fine fresh butter: mix it well
over a clear fire, and when it begins to froth, hold it up higher. When
of a very fine dark brown, pour in a small quantity of a pint of port
wine; and the whole by very slow degrees, stirring all the time. Put to
the above half an ounce of Jamaica, and the same of black pepper, six
cloves of shalots peeled, three blades of mace bruised, three spoonfuls
of mushroom, and the same of walnut catsup, some salt, and the finely
pared rind of a lemon. Boil gently fifteen minutes; pour it into a bason
till cold; take off the scum, and bottle for use.
_To make Sprats taste like Anchovies._
Salt them well, and let the salt drain from them. In twenty four hours
wipe them dry, but do not wash them. Mix four ounces of common salt, an
ounce of bay salt, an ounce of saltpetre, a quarter of an ounce of sal
prunel, and half a teaspoonful of cochineal, all in the finest powder.
Sprinkle it among three quarts of the fish, and pack them in two stone
jars. Keep in a cold place, fastened down with a bladder.
These are pleasant on bread and butter: but have the best for sauce.
_To keep Anchovies when the liquor dries._
Pour on them beef brine.
_To keep Capers._
Add fresh vinegar, that has been scalded, and become cold; and tie them
close, to keep out the air.
_To make Mustard._
Mix the best Durham flour of mustard by degrees, with boiling water, to
a proper thickness, rubbing it perfectly smooth: add a little salt, and
keep it in a small jar, close covered; and put only as much into the
glass as will be used soon; which should be wiped daily round the edges.
_Another way for immediate use._
Mix the mustard with new milk by degrees, to be quite smooth, and add a
little raw cream. It is much softer this way, is not bitter, and will
keep well.
The patent mustard is by many preferred, and it is perhaps as cheap,
being always ready: and if the pots are returned, three pence is allowed
for each.
A teaspoonful of sugar to half a pint of mustard, is a great
improvement, and softens it.
PICKLES.
_India._
Lay a pound of white ginger in water one night: then scrape, slice, and
lay it in salt in a pan till the other ingredients shall be ready.
Peel, slice, and salt a pound of garlick three days; then put it in the
sun to dry. Salt and dry long pepper in the same way.
Prepare various sorts of vegetables thus:
Quarter small white cabbages: salt three days: squeeze and set them in
the sun to dry.
Cauliflowers cut in their branches: take off the green from radishes:
cut celery in three inch lengths: ditto French beans whole, likewise the
shoots of alder, which will look like bamboo. Apples and cucumbers,
choose of the least seedy sort; cut them in slices, or quarters, if not
too large. All must be salted, drained, and dried in the sun, except the
latter; over which you must pour boiling vinegar, and, in twelve hours,
drain them, but no salt must be used.
Put the spice, garlick, a quarter of a pound of mustardseed, and as much
vinegar as you think enough for the quantity you are to pickle, into a
large stonejar, and one ounce of turmeric to be ready against the
vegetables shall be dried. When they are ready, observe the following
directions: put some of them into a two quart stonejar, and pour over
them one quart of boiling vinegar: next day take out those vegetables,
and when drained, put them into a large stock jar, and boiling the
vinegar, pour it over some more of the vegetables; let them lie a night,
and do as above. Thus proceed till you have cleansed each set from the
dust which must inevitably fall on them by being so long in doing: then,
to every gallon of vinegar, put two ounces of flour of mustard, mixing,
by degrees, with a little of it boiling hot. The whole of the vinegar
should have been previously scalded, but left to be cool before put to
the spice. Stop the jar tight.
This pickle will not be ready for a year; but you may make a small jar
for eating in a fortnight, by only giving them one scald in water, after
salting and drying as above, but without the preparative vinegar; then
pour the vinegar that has the spice and garlick, boiling hot over. If at
any time it be found that the vegetables have not swelled properly,
boiling the pickle, and pouring it over them hot, will plump them.
_English Bamboo, to Pickle._
Cut the large young shoots of alder, which put out in the middle of May,
(the middle stalks are most tender) peel off the outward peel, or skin,
and lay them in salt and water, very strong, one night. Dry them piece
by piece in a cloth. Have in readiness a pickle thus made and boiled. To
a quart of vinegar put an ounce of white pepper, an ounce of sliced
ginger, a little mace and pimento, and pour boiling on the alder shoots,
in a stonejar: stop close, and set by the fire two hours, turning the
jar often, to keep scalding hot. If not green when cold, strain, off the
liquor, and pour boiling hot again; keeping it hot as before. Or, if you
intend to make Indian pickle, the above shoots are a great improvement
to it: in which case you need only pour boiling vinegar and mustardseed
on them; and keep them till your jar of pickles shall be ready to
receive them.
_Melon Mangoes._
There is a particular sort for this purpose which the gardeners know.
Cut a square small piece out of one side, and through that take out the
seeds, and mix with them mustard seeds and shred garlick; stuff the
melon as full as the space will allow, and replace the square piece.
Bind it up with a small new packthread. Boil a good quantity of vinegar,
to allow for wasting, with peppers, salt, ginger, and pour boiling hot
over the mangoes four successive days; the last, put flour of mustard,
and scraped horseradish into the vinegar just as it boils up. Stop
close. Observe that there is plenty of vinegar. All pickles are spoiled
if not well covered. Mangoes should be done soon after they are
gathered.
_Pickled Onions._
In the month of September, choose the small white round onions, take off
the brown skin; have ready a very nice tin stewpan of boiling water;
throw in as many onions as will cover the top. As soon as they look
clear on the outside, take them up as quick as possible with a slice,
and lay them on a clean cloth, cover them close with another, and scald
some more, and so on. Let them lie to be cold, then put them in a jar,
or glass widemouth bottle, and pour over them the best white wine
vinegar, just hot, but not boiling. When cold, cover them.
_Cucumbers and Onions sliced._
Cut them in slices, and sprinkle salt over them: next day drain them for
five or six hours, then put them into a jar, and pour boiling vinegar
over them, keeping in a warm place. The slices should be thick. Repeat
the boiling vinegar, and stop instantly; and so on till green.
_Pickled sliced Cucumbers, another way._
Slice large unpared cucumbers, an inch thick; slice onions, and put both
into a broad pan: strew a good deal of salt among them. In twenty four
hours drain them, and then lay them on a cloth to dry. Put them in small
stonejars, and pour in the strongest plain vinegar, boiling hot: stop
the jars close. Next day boil it again, and pour over, and thus thrice;
the last time add whole white pepper, and a little ginger. Keep close
covered.
_Young Cucumbers._
Choose nice young gherkins; spread them on dishes; salt them, and let
them lie a week: drain them, and, putting them in a jar, pour boiling
vinegar over them. Set them near the fire, covered with plenty of
vineleaves. If they do not become a tolerable good green, pour the
vinegar into another jar, set it over the hot hearth, and when it boils,
pour it over them again, covering with fresh leaves; and thus do till
they are of as good a colour as you wish: but as it is now known, that
the very fine green pickles are made so by using brass or bell metal
vessels, which, when vinegar is put into them, become highly poisonous,
few people like to eat them.
_Note._ Acids dissolve the lead in the tinning of saucepans. Pickles
should never be kept in glazed jars, but in stone or glass; and vinegar,
or any acids, should be boiled, by putting them in jars of stone, over a
hot hearth, or in a kettle of water.
_To Pickle Walnuts._
When they will bear a pin to go into them, put on them a brine of salt
and water boiled, and strong enough to bear an egg, being quite cold
first. It must be well skimmed while boiling. Let them soak twelve days,
then drain them, and pour over them in the jar a pickle of the best
white wine vinegar, with a good quantity of pepper, pimento, ginger,
mace, cloves, mustardseed, and horseradish; all boiled together, but
cold. To every hundred of walnuts, put six spoonfuls of mustardseed, and
two or three heads of garlick, or shalot; but the latter is least
strong.
Thus done, they will be good for several years, if kept close covered.
The air will soften them. They will not be fit to eat under six months.
The pickle will serve as good catsup, when the walnuts are used.
_Nasturtions, for Capers._
Keep them a few days after they are gathered; then pour boiling vinegar
over them, and when cold, cover.
They will not be fit to eat for some months; but are then finely
flavoured, and by many preferred to capers.
_An excellent way to Pickle Mushrooms, to preserve the flavour._
Buttons must be rubbed with a bit of flannel and salt; and from the
larger, take out the _red_ inside, for when they are _black_ they will
not do, being too old. Throw a little salt over, and put them into a
stewpan, with some mace, and pepper. As the liquor comes out, shake them
well, and keep them over a gentle fire till all of it be dried into them
again; then put as much vinegar into the pan as will cover them; give it
one warm, and turn all into a glass or stonejar. They will keep two
years, and are delicious.
_Red Cabbage._
Slice it into a colander, and sprinkle each layer with salt; let it
drain two days, then put it into a jar, and pour boiling vinegar enough
to cover, and put a few slices of red beet root. Observe to choose the
purple red cabbage. Those who like the flavour of spice, will boil it
with the vinegar. Cauliflower, cut in branches, and thrown in after
being salted, will look of a beautiful red.
_To Stew Green Peas._
Put a quart of pease, a lettuce, an onion, both sliced, a bit of butter,
pepper, salt, and no more water than hangs round the lettuce from
washing. Stew them two hours very gently. When to be served, beat up an
egg, and stir into them, or a bit of flour and butter.
Some think a teaspoonful of white powdered sugar is an improvement.
Gravy may be added; but there will be less of the flavour of the peas.
Chop a bit of mint, and stew in them.
_To stew Cucumbers._
Slice them thick, or halve, and divide them in two lengths: strew some
salt and pepper, and slice onions; add a little broth, or a bit of
butter. Simmer very slowly; and, before serving, if no butter was in
before, put some, and a little flour; or if it was in, only a little
flour, unless it wants richness.
_Another way._
Slice the onions, and cut the cucumbers large; flour and fry them in
some butter: then pour on some good broth or gravy, and stew till
enough. Skim off the fat.
_Stewed Onions._
Peel six large onions: fry them gently of a fine brown, but do not
blacken; then put them in a small stewpan, with a little weak gravy,
pepper, and salt: cover and stew two hours gently. They should be
lightly floured at first.
_Roast Onions._
Should be done with all the skins on. They eat well alone, with salt
only, and cold butter; or with roast potatoes, or with beetroots.
_Stewed Celery._
Wash, and strip off the outer leaves of six heads; halve, or leave them
whole according to their size; cut them in four inch lengths. Put them
in a stewpan with a cup of broth, or weak white gravy. Stew till tender;
then add two spoonfuls of cream, and a little flour and butter, seasoned
with pepper, salt, and nutmeg, and simmer all together.
_Cauliflower in white Sauce._
Half boil, then cut into handsome pieces, and lay into a stewpan, with a
little broth, a bit of mace, a little salt, and a dust of white pepper.
Simmer half an hour; then put a little cream, butter, and flour; shake
and simmer a few minutes, and serve.
_Spinach_
Should be very carefully picked and washed; then boil, and squeeze it
dry. Put it in a pan with a bit of butter, salt, and pepper; stew it,
and serve.
_French way._
Clean as before; then put it into a stewpan without water, a spoonful of
gravy, and a lump of butter, salt, and pepper, and simmer till ready. If
too moist, squeeze the gravy from it.
_Stewed Red Cabbage._
Slice a small, or half a large red cabbage: wash it, and put into a
saucepan, with pepper and salt, no water but what hangs about the
former, and a piece of butter. Stew till quite tender; then when going
to serve, put to it half a cup of vinegar, and stir it over the fire.
Serve for cold meat, or with sausages on it.
_Stewed Mushrooms._
Choose large buttons, or small flaps, before the fringe be turned black:
pick each one separately, and observe there is not a bad one; rub the
former, with a flannel and salt, skin the latter, and take out the
fringe. Throw them into a stewpan, with a little salt, a piece of
butter, and a few peppers; set them on a slack part of the fire, and
shake them sometime. When tender, add two large spoonfuls of cream, and
a dust of flour.
_Stewed Sorrel for Fricandeau, and roast Meat._
Wash the sorrel, and put it in a silver vessel, or stonejar, and no more
water than hangs to the leaves. Simmer in the slowest way you can; and
when done enough, put a bit of butter, and beat it well.
_Stewed Carrots._
Half boil, then nicely scrape, and slice them into a stewpan. Put to
them half a teacup of any weak broth, some pepper, and salt, and half a
cup of cream; simmer to be very tender, but not broke. Before serving,
rub the least flour with a bit of butter, and warm up with it. If
approved, chopped parsley may be added ten minutes before served.
_Stewed old Peas._
Steep them in water all night, if not fine boilers, otherwise only half
an hour; put them with water enough just to cover them, and a good bit
of butter, or a piece of beef or pork. Stew in the most gentle way till
the peas are soft, and the meat is tender. If not salt meat, add salt,
and a little pepper, and serve round the meat.
_French Sallad._
Chop three anchovies, a shalot, and some parsley small; put them in a
bowl with two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one of oil, a little mustard,
and salt. When well mixed, add by degrees some cold roast or boiled meat
in the very thinnest slices; put in a few at a time, they being small,
not exceeding two or three inches long; shake them in the seasoning, and
then put more; cover the bowl close; and let the sallad be prepared
three hours before it be eaten.
Garnish with parsley, and a few slices of the fat.
_Lobster Sallad._
Make a sallad, and put some of the red part of the lobster to it, cut;
which forms a pretty contrast to the white and green of the vegetables.
Do not put much oil, as shellfish take off the acidity of vinegar.
Serve in a dish, not a bowl.
_To boil Potatoes._
Set them on a fire, unpared, in cold water; let them half boil, then
throw some salt in, and a pint of cold water, and let them boil again
till near done. Pour off the water, and put a clean cloth over them, and
then the saucepan cover, and set them by the fire to steam till ready.
Many use steamers.
_To broil Potatoes._
Parboil, then slice and broil them; or parboil, and set them whole on
the gridiron over a very slow fire; and when thoroughly done, send up
with their skins on. The latter is done in many Irish families.
_To roast Potatoes._
Half boil, take off the thin peel, and roast them of a beautiful brown.
_To fry Potatoes._
Slice raw potatoes after the skin is removed, and fry either in butter,
or thin batter.
_To mash Potatoes._
Boil, peel, and break to paste the potatoes; then, to two pounds, add a
quarter of a pint of milk, and a little salt, with two or three ounces
of butter, and stir all well over the fire. Serve thus, or brown the
top, when placed on the dish in a form, with a salamander; or in
scollops.
_To mash Parsnips._
Boil tender; scrape them; then mash into a stewpan, with a little cream,
a good piece of butter, pepper, and salt.
_To keep Green Peas._
Shell, and put them into a kettle of water when it boils: give them two
or three warms only, and pour them into a colander. When the water
drains off, turn them on a dresser covered with cloth; pour them on
another cloth to dry perfectly: then bottle them in widemouth bottles,
leaving only room to pour clarified mutton suet upon them an inch thick,
and for the cork; rosin it down, and keep in a cellar, or in the earth,
as ordered for gooseberries. Boil them, with a bit of butter, a spoonful
of sugar, and a bit of mint, till tender, when to be used.
_Another way, as practised in the Emperor of Russia’s Kitchen._
Shell, scald, and dry as above. Put them on tins or earthen dishes in a
cool oven to harden, once or twice. Keep them in paper bags hung up in
the kitchen. When to be used, let them lie an hour in water; then set
them on with cold water, and a bit of butter, and boil till ready. Put a
sprig of dried mint to boil with them.
_To preserve French Beans, to eat in the Winter._
Pick them young, and throw into a little wooden keg a layer three inches
deep; then sprinkle with salt: put another layer of beans, and do the
same as high as you think proper, alternately with salt; but do not be
too liberal of the latter: lay a plate, or cover of wood that will go
into the keg, and put on it a heavy stone. A pickle will rise from the
beans and salt. If too salt, the soaking and boiling will not be
sufficient to make them pleasant to the taste. When to be eaten, cut,
soak, and boil as when fresh.
Potatoes should be kept in the earth that adheres to them when dug; and
preserved from frost.
Carrots, parsnips, and turnips the same, and put in layers of dry sand.
Small close cabbages laid on a stone floor before the frost sets in,
will blanch and be very fine, after many weeks’ keeping.
_To boil Vegetables Green._
Be sure the water boils when you put them in; when in, make them boil
very fast. Do not cover, but watch them; and if the water has not
slackened, you may be assured they are done when they are beginning to
sink; take them out immediately, or the colour will change.
_Small Dishes for Supper, &c._
Boil eggs hard, cut them in half, take out the yelks, set the whites on
a dish, and fill with the following several ingredients; or put a saucer
upside down on a plate, and place them in quarters round: in either case
as a salmagundi. Chopped veal, yelk of egg, beetroot, anchovy, apple,
onion, ham, and parsley. A very small bit of the white of the egg must
be cut off, to make it stand on the dish as a cup.
_Orange Butter._
Boil six eggs hard: beat the yelks in a mortar with fine sugar, orange
flower water, four ounces of butter, and two ounces of almonds beaten to
a paste. When all is mixed, rub it through a colander on a dish.
Roll butter in different forms; either like a pine, having made it in
the shape of a cone, and marking it with a teaspoon; or rolling in a
